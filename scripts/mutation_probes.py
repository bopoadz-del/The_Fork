r"""Named mutation probes over decision code. Reject, never repair.

Every PR in this repo carries a RECEIPT with a "mutants run/survivors"
line, and every one of them has said UNPRODUCED, because nothing in the
tree could produce the number. A coverage percentage says a line ran; it
does not say a test would have noticed if the line were wrong. These
probes say that, for the handful of lines where being wrong is expensive.

Each probe replaces ONE exact substring in ONE file with a plausible wrong
version -- a guard turned off, a fence widened -- and runs the ONE test
that must catch it. A probe whose test stays green is a SURVIVOR and fails
this script: the guard is not actually guarded.

The targets are deliberately few and deliberately load-bearing. This is
not a coverage tool.

A killed run leaves ``.mutation_in_flight`` beside the mutated file's
original bytes, and the next start restores it before doing anything else.
Without that, a Ctrl-C in the middle leaves a sabotaged guard on disk that
looks like a clean working tree -- which is how a disabled monitor once
shipped in a sibling repo, twice, before anyone noticed.
