"""Build the prioritized ingestion manifest for server-side Phase 1b.

Reads the existing Drive manifest (p1a_drive_manifest_client.json) and the
known top-level Drive folders, then assigns each folder to a tier:

  Tier 1: the client project + golden-set/fixture-backing folders
  Tier 2: Other pilot-relevant project/procedure folders
  Tier 3: Archives, scanned reference material, everything else

Outputs manifests/p1b_priority_manifest.json.

This script does NOT perform ingestion; it only produces the manifest that
the server-side job will consume.
