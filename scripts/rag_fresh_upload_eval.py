"""Fresh-upload-wins eval (RAG_AUDIT_V2, new eval class).

Question being measured: when a project has its OWN freshly uploaded document
and the master/GK corpus contains topically similar material, does
project-scoped retrieval rank the fresh upload's chunks first?

Method (read-mostly; the only mutation is one clearly named eval project plus
small .txt uploads into it — projects must never be deleted, see the schema's
ON DELETE CASCADE on RAG chunks):

  1. create project "RAG Audit V2 - Fresh Upload Eval" (or reuse by name)
  2. upload N small .txt notes; each states a project-specific fact whose
     TOPIC deliberately overlaps the GK/master corpus (lighting wattage,
     FIDIC notice period, design-review statuses, BOQ rates...) but whose
     VALUE is unique to the project
  3. wait for eager indexing
  4. for each case, POST /v1/rag/search with the eval project's id and ask
     for the fact; PASS = a chunk from the uploaded doc is top-1
     (top-3 tracked as a softer signal)

Auth/target env: FORK_API_KEY / FORK_TOKEN / FORK_EMAIL+FORK_PASSWORD,
FORK_BASE_URL (default prod).

Usage:
  python scripts/rag_fresh_upload_eval.py            # full run
  python scripts/rag_fresh_upload_eval.py --query-only --project <id>
                                                     # re-query an existing run
