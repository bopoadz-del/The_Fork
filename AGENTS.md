## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

The Fork is a **FastAPI** backend (`app/`) plus a **React + Vite + TypeScript**
frontend (`frontend/`). Cloud Agent bootstrap is repo-managed in
`.cursor/environment.json` (Python 3.11 venv + `frontend` `npm ci`, uvicorn on
`:8000`). The notes below cover only non-obvious run/test caveats. For full
detail see `README.md`, `.env.example`, and `.claude/skills/run-the-fork/SKILL.md`.

### Runtime prerequisites (baked into the environment, not the update script)
- **Python 3.11** is required (`.python-version` / `runtime.txt`; `requirements.txt`
  is pinned for 3.11). The venv is built with `python3.11`, not the system 3.12.
- System packages the app needs at runtime: `tesseract-ocr` (+ `tesseract-ocr-ara`),
  `antiword`, `unrar`, `libgl1`, `libglib2.0-0`, `libmagic1` (see `Aptfile` /
  `render-build.sh`). These live in the base image, not the update script.

### Running the backend
- Dev launch: `./start-local.sh` (binds `0.0.0.0:8000`, sets `ENV=development`,
  `DATA_DIR=$PWD/data`, `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8`). It uses the system `uvicorn`,
  so activate `.venv` first or run uvicorn from the venv directly:
  `CEREBRUM_VIRGIN=false CEREBRUM_DOMAIN_KITS=construction ENV=development \
  DATA_DIR="$PWD/data" .venv/bin/python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`
- `ENV=development` is mandatory: it skips the production startup guard and
  enables the dev API key. All `/v1/*` calls need `Authorization: Bearer cb_dev_key`
  (that key is rejected unless `ENV=development`).
- No database is required locally: with `DATABASE_URL` unset the app uses SQLite
  at `$DATA_DIR/the_fork.db`. Postgres 16 + pgvector is the production config only.
- The production block profile is `CEREBRUM_VIRGIN=false` +
  `CEREBRUM_DOMAIN_KITS=construction` (loads 48 blocks). Unset/`true` loads a
  smaller generic set; some tests only run under the full profile.
- First boot downloads the `model2vec` embedder (`minishlab/potion-base-8M`) from
  Hugging Face into `HF_HOME`; needs network once. For tests set
  `RAG_EMBEDDING_MODEL=fake` to skip the download.
- Registration auto-verifies in dev (no `RESEND_API_KEY`), so you can
  `POST /v1/users/register` then `/v1/users/login` and use the app without email.
- LLM chat (`/v1/chat/stream`, `/v1/agents/*/chat`) needs a funded `KIMI_API_KEY`
  or `GROQ_API_KEY`; everything else (auth, projects, uploads, block `/v1/execute`)
  works without any provider key.

### Frontend
- The chat UI is a **build artifact** — `frontend/dist` is gitignored and NOT
  committed, so the update script does not build it. uvicorn only serves the real
  UI at `/` once `frontend/dist` exists. Build it with
  `npm --prefix frontend run build`, then (re)start uvicorn. Without a build, `/`
  returns a tiny placeholder page while the API and `/docs` still work.
- For hot-reload dev use `npm --prefix frontend run dev` (Vite on `:5173`). There
  is no dev proxy; it calls the backend directly at `VITE_API_BASE`
  (default `http://localhost:8000`), so keep uvicorn running alongside it.

### Lint / test
- Backend fast gate: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/e2e/ -q` (seconds). Full
  suite (`pytest tests/`) is ~35-40 min. Before pushing run
  `.venv/bin/python scripts/test_matrix.py` — CI runs the suite under BOTH the
  virgin and construction profiles and a plain `pytest tests/` covers only one.
- Frontend lint: `npm --prefix frontend run lint` (eslint; errors block CI,
  warnings are allowed). Context files (`AuthContext`, `ThemeContext`) keep a
  file-level `react-refresh/only-export-components` disable because the hook
  lives next to the provider.
- Leftover L1 named-file fetch: `_predispatch_file_tool` runs `fetch_document`
  for `.txt`/`.md`/`.docx`/`.doc` when the user names the file (full name or a
  ≥12-char stem, so `khor_waterproofing_spec` matches a timestamped upload).
  Empty RAG chunks fall through to disk `extract_document_text`. Do **not**
  re-ingest/reindex that docx; another agent owns RAG. Predispatch runs
  **before** the identifier RAG-miss short-circuit — a timestamped `.docx`
  looks like a drawing code and used to return "could not confirm this
  reference" in ~1s without fetching bytes.
- Clash detection stays **off** unless the user message contains `clash`.
  Predispatch then sets `run_clash_detection: True`. Default-on was hung on
  leftover L2 geom — do not flip the default.
- Named-calculator override (`_message_wants_named_calculator`) keeps
  "interim payment" + figures on `construction_calc`. A no-figure
  "issue/generate … payment certificate" is **not** stolen; it stays a
  `payment_certificate` deliverable (honest missing-`contract_value` is OK).
- Leftover L6 (trench bank volume): the smart-orchestrator hat calls
  `construction` with `action=construction_calc`. That action is aliased to
  the formula registry (`excavation_volume` for L×W×D). Extra LLM kwargs
  such as `text` are stripped. Do not send the model to `drawing_qto` when
  the user already supplied the dimensions.
- Currency rate units (`AED/m2`, `USD/ft2`) are not document identifiers.
  Pinned self-coding conversions must not hit the RAG-miss short-circuit.
- Python lint gates: `scripts/audit_stubs.py` and `scripts/scan_secrets.py` (stdlib
  only). The ruff S110 gate uses ruff, which is **not** in `requirements.txt` — CI
  installs `ruff==0.16.1` on demand; do the same locally if you need it
  (`pip install ruff==0.16.1`).

### Production Render (non-obvious)
- Live service is `the-fork` (`srv-d9s6l67avr4c73aiujsg`) at `https://theshovel.ai`. `autoDeploy` is **false** (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`). A Render API deploy **without** `commitId` ships whatever is currently on `main`, not the feature-branch SHA. Pass the pushed commit explicitly.
- `/v1/agents/*/chat` and `/v1/chat/stream` conversation ids must be `ws-{projectId}-{unix_ms}` only. Extra path segments 404.
- Kimi HTTP 400 on orphaned `tool_call_id`s ("must be followed by tool messages") or `tokenization failed` is retryable: skip any remaining Moonshot hop and take `LLM_FALLBACK_PROVIDER` (Groq). Generic 400/401/403/404 still do not fall back. User nudges wait until every tool in the assistant batch has a result so the pairing 400 is not generated in the first place.

### Stale docs to ignore
- `README.md` and `.claude/skills/run-the-fork/SKILL.md` claim the React frontend
  was deleted and only `app/static/index.html` is served. That is outdated: the
  Vite React app in `frontend/` is the real UI (served from `frontend/dist`).
