# ── Bake the RAG embedder weights into the image ────────────────────────────
#
# WHY: the weights were never in the image. Only the LIBRARIES were installed,
# so the first embed call resolved the model name against huggingface.co at
# RUNTIME via snapshot_download. Render containers are ephemeral and no
# HF_HOME/persistent cache was configured, which made every deploy, restart and
# scale event re-download the model — a live third-party host sitting in the
# boot path of the retrieval stack.
#
# The failure mode was silent, which is what made it dangerous: doc_index wraps
# its RAG hook in try/except, so a failed download meant a document was stored,
# registered and listed while being indexed with ZERO chunks. No failed upload,
# no error in the UI — just a document that is permanently unsearchable. A live
# 403 from the Hub reproduced exactly that.
#
# Baking it here makes the image self-contained: the model is present before
# the container ever starts, and HF_HUB_OFFLINE in the runtime stage means a
# network fetch cannot be attempted at all.
#
# The model name is an ARG so it stays single-sourced, but it MUST match what
# the running corpus was embedded with. Vectors carry an embedding identity
# ({model, dim, normalized}) and VectorStore._verify_embedding_identity refuses
# a namespace whose stamp disagrees — so changing this value without
# re-embedding the corpus takes retrieval down.
#
# Default is the live worker/web model (BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5, dim 384).
# CI and a bare `docker build .` do not pass --build-arg; leaving the old
# potion-base-8M default here baked the wrong weights and HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1
# could not recover (LocalEntryNotFoundError → RAG_INDEX_FAILED).

# production build takes it from there: deploy-aws.yml passes that ECR image
# as ODA_DONOR_IMAGE. CI and local builds get busybox and no converter —
# app.blocks.drawing_qto then tells the operator DWG needs the converter.
# Self-describing: the file set is dpkg's own manifest for the package that
# owns /usr/bin/ODAFileConverter (plus anything under that name), so no

# rebuild a donor from the .deb and repoint ODA_DONOR_IMAGE.
