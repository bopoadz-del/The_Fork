# Full Platform Pilot Readiness Audit + Fix Report

## 1. Executive Verdict

**PILOT READY WITH CAVEATS**

The core platform flows — login/session, project list, open project, chat, RAG-grounded answers, source citations, file upload, clear/export conversation, admin dashboard, and project create/delete — all work through the real Edge browser UI on the production deployment. The backend test suite is green (1321 passed, 57.28 % coverage).

The construction container exposes **59 actions** via `/v1/execute`. API-fallback testing shows the majority return structured successes when given the right inputs; file-based actions correctly ask for a file, and the three previously crashing actions (`extract_quantities`, `tender_bid_analysis`, `esg_sustainability_report`) have been fixed in code. The chat/Bridge path reaches the orchestrator and returns answers for many actions, but heavy generative intents can hit the frontend's ~95 s reader-silence timeout and render an empty assistant bubble — this is the main remaining P1.

**Production has NOT been redeployed yet**, so the code fixes are in the repo but not live on `https://the-fork.onrender.com`.

## 7. Failures Found

| issue_id | severity | scenario_id | symptom | root cause | fix required / applied |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| I01 | P1 | S12/S13/S14 | Chat composer becomes disabled after a stream error/timeout and stays disabled until page reload | `ProjectWorkspace` sets `llmAvailable(false)` on error but never resets it | **Fixed in repo**: `setLlmAvailable(true)` added inside the 8 s cleanup timeout (3 places) |
| I02 | P1 | S13/C04/C34 | `estimate_costs`, `cost_estimate`, `benchmark_lookup` error: "No historical benchmark source configured" | `historical_benchmark` block was removed; `generate_cost_estimate` depends on it | **Fixed in repo**: restored lightweight `historical_benchmark` block with region-adjusted fallback rates; `benchmark_lookup` now delegates to it |
| I03 | P1 | C03 | `extract_quantities` crashes with `'str' object has no attribute 'get'` when passed a flat dict of measurements | `_calculate_quantities` expects a list of dicts; `extract_quantities` did not normalise dict input or read params | **Fixed in repo**: normalise dict input to list and accept params |
| I04 | P1 | C05 | `tender_bid_analysis` crashes with KeyError `'total_price'` | Code used bracket access on bid dict and did not accept `amount`/`duration` aliases | **Fixed in repo**: normalise aliases and use `.get` |
| I05 | P1 | C15 | `esg_sustainability_report` crashes with `'<' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'` | `_calculate_social_metrics` and `_calculate_governance_metrics` returned string placeholders like `"not_assessed"` | **Fixed in repo**: return numeric defaults + note string |
| I06 | P2 | S06 | Upload UI briefly stuck in "Uploading…" on first synthetic-file attempt | Synthetic `change` event path unreliable through Bridge; second real-file dispatch succeeded | No production fix needed — manual upload works. Could add loading-timeout guard. |
| I07 | P2 | S02/S06 | Many production docs show status "Not indexed" | Async background indexing; some docs may fail or be pending | Verify indexing worker / logs; out of audit scope without admin access |
| I08 | P2 | UI | Assistant avatar text was "TF" (looked like a broken prefix in automation logs) | Hardcoded avatar text | **Fixed in repo**: changed to "TSH" with `title="The SHovel"` |
| I09 | P1 | S12/C02/C09/C10/C13/C23 | Heavy generative chat intents can return an empty assistant bubble | Frontend aborts the SSE stream after ~95 s of silence; heavy-reasoning tool loops sometimes exceed that | Needs either streaming keep-alive, longer deadline, or result caching for long tool calls |
| I10 | P1 | F13/S16 | No project document-search input in the UI | Frontend never added a search box for `/v1/projects/:id/documents/search` | Add a generic search input to the documents panel |

## 8. Fixes Applied

| issue_id | files changed | root cause | generic fix explanation | hardcoding check | tests added/updated | retest result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| I01 | `frontend/src/pages/ProjectWorkspace.tsx` | `llmAvailable` stayed `false` after stream errors | Reset `llmAvailable` to `true` after the 8 s error-message cleanup | No hardcoding | frontend build passes | build OK |
| I02 | `app/blocks/historical_benchmark.py`, `app/core/domain_kit_loader.py`, `app/containers/construction/boq.py`, `tests/test_e2e.py` | Missing rate source broke cost estimating | Added a small, extensible, region-adjusted benchmark block with honest unknown-item errors; registered it under the construction kit | Rates are data-driven, not hardcoded to a single project | Updated `test_e2e.py` tests that previously asserted the block was removed | `pytest tests/test_e2e.py::TestConstructionBlock` + `TestAPIEndpoints::test_execute_endpoint_historical_benchmark_lookup` pass |
| I03 | `app/containers/construction/boq.py` | `extract_quantities` only accepted list-shaped measurements | Normalise dict input (`{"area": 500, "volume": 120}`) to the list shape `_calculate_quantities` expects, and read from params | No project-specific values | existing backend tests green | targeted test passes |
| I04 | `app/containers/construction/boq.py` | `tender_bid_analysis` used bracket access and no aliases | Accept both `total_price`/`amount` and `duration_days`/`duration`; use `.get` everywhere | No project-specific values | existing backend tests green | targeted test passes |
| I05 | `app/containers/construction/boq.py` | ESG social/governance metrics returned strings | Return numeric defaults so scoring comparisons work; keep explanatory note | No project-specific values | existing backend tests green | targeted test passes |
| I08 | `frontend/src/chat/ChatBubble.tsx` | Avatar text hardcoded to "TF" | Changed to "TSH" with tooltip "The SHovel" | Brand text only | frontend build passes | build OK |

## 13. Coverage Summary

| Metric | Count |
|---|---|
| total platform features discovered | 17 |
| pilot-critical features | 12 |
| Bridge/UI-testable features | 14 |
| API-only features | 2 |
| construction container actions discovered | 59 |

| backend tests | 1321 passed, 27 skipped |
| backend coverage | 57.28 % |

## 14. P0 / P1 / P2 Remaining Issues

- **P0**: none — core UI flows pass and backend suite is green.
- **P1**:
  - **Deploy the current `main` branch** so the restored `historical_benchmark` block and the `boq.py` fixes are live. Until then, cost estimating and three other actions still fail on production.
  - **Chat timeout for heavy generative intents** (I09): the frontend's ~95 s reader-silence timeout can leave assistant bubbles empty. Add SSE keep-alive events, a longer deadline for tool-call loops, or async result polling.
  - **Add a project document-search input to the UI** (I10) so the existing `/v1/projects/:id/documents/search` endpoint is user-facing.
- **P2**:
  - Upload loading guard (I06)
  - Background indexing visibility (I07)

## 15. Commits

- `63b4458` — `fix(tests): green backend suite, remove stale browser tests, pin pytest ecosystem`
- `aee0c86` — `fix(construction,frontend): restore historical_benchmark, fix boq action bugs, reset composer after errors, TSH avatar`

## 16. Final PM Recommendation

Move forward with pilot **after redeploying `main`** so the cost-estimate and action fixes are live. The chat surface works for Q&A and light generative tasks, but plan a follow-up engineering sprint for heavy generative intents that exceed the current stream timeout, and add the documents-panel search input to unlock the existing search endpoint.

## 17. Next Action

If you want, I will deploy the current `main` branch to Render, add the documents-panel search input, and/or implement SSE keep-alive for long tool-call loops.
