# Construction capability audit — 2026-08-12

Every construction capability was put against three bars. A capability passes
only if it clears all three.

| Bar | Question | How it was answered |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Not a stub.** Does it compute, or does it return a shaped constant? | Read the body; run it on a real input; look for placeholder values and empty successes. |
| 2 | **Current version.** Is this the live implementation, or a stale twin the router forgot? | Compare against same-named / similar-named siblings; check what the caller surfaces actually name; check whether tests validate against production or against their own copy of it. |
| 3 | **Really tested.** Would the suite notice if it broke? | **Control-delete**: replace the whole body with a shape-only return, run the tests that claim to cover it, and require RED. Restore, require GREEN. |

Bar 3 is the one that finds things. A capability can be real, current and
completely unprotected — and in this codebase, most of the gaps were exactly
that shape.

---

## Results

| Capability | Bar 1 | Bar 2 | Bar 3 | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| BOQ | pass | pass | **FAIL** | `boq_process` gutted → tests green. Strengthened with payload assertions. |
| Documents | pass | pass | **FAIL** | `process_document` gutted → **148 passed**. Net-new payload tests. |
| Schedule — `parse_primavera_schedule` | pass | pass | pass | 2 RED on a real `.xer`. |
| Schedule — `generate_wbs` | pass | pass | pass | 14 RED. |
| Schedule — `resource_histogram` | pass | pass | pass | 7 RED. |
| Schedule — `forensic_delay_analysis` | pass | pass | **FAIL** | Gutted → 16 tests still green. Net-new payload tests. |
| Cross-cutting — router surface | **FAIL** | **FAIL** | **FAIL** | 3 unreachable actions; 2 of them unrunnable; 1 false-green test; 1 placeholder value. |
| Chat | pass | pass | pass | Gutting the RAG-default + prompt-injection policy turned 3 of 45 red. |
| QTO / Formulas / orchestration | pass | pass | **FAIL** | 10 pure delegations, near-zero coverage. `formula_execute` and `orchestrate` were referenced by no test at all. |
| Agents — imports | — | **FAIL** | — | `app.agents.catalog` / `activation` unimportable by package path; 33 tests passed via a `sys.path` hack that also concealed it. |
| Agents — `runtime.py` core | pass | pass | pass | 7 methods gutted, all RED (`_run_tool_call` 13, `chat` 14, `chat_stream` 7…). |
| Agents — `runtime.py` LLM + envelope | pass | pass | **FAIL** | 5 methods (702 lines) gutted → all 150 tests green. `_call_llm` is mocked 65×; `_auto_validate` had zero references. |
| Agents — tool surface | pass | pass | pass | 14 live agents, 0 undispatchable tools. |
| Agents — discipline hats | **FAIL** | — | — | Dormant second system; 32 of 35 declared actions dispatch to nothing. Registered, fenced. |

Every capability has now been through all three bars.

The strongest capability in the container is `parse_primavera_schedule`, and
the reason is instructive: it is the one with a **real file** behind its tests.
`tests/test_real_project_fixtures.py` asserts `project_duration == 459`,
`data_date == "2013-11-27"` and exactly 19 critical-path activities against a
1.6 MB Primavera baseline. Every capability that failed bar 3 was tested only
through routing or synthetic shape assertions. That correlation held for every
capability examined, and it is the best available predictor for the ones still
pending.

---

## What bar 3 actually caught

### `boq_process` — a status check cannot see an empty workbook

`tests/test_synthetic_fixture_actions.py` dispatched the action and asserted
`status == "success"`. Replacing the body with
`{"status": "success", "items": [], "total": 0}` kept it green. The action
could have stopped reading the file entirely.

Now asserts the line-item count and the arithmetic total off the synthetic
workbook.

### `process_document` — the entry point for twelve actions, zero payload coverage

Gutted to a shape-only return, **148 tests passed**. Every existing reference
was a string in a routing table, an entry in a feature manifest, or an
anti-hijack guard that wires `object()` in its place. Those prove the *router*
reaches it. None proved it reads a file.

`tests/test_process_document_payload.py` asserts `C32/40` — a value that can
only appear in the output if the specification was opened and parsed.

### `forensic_delay_analysis` — the expensive one to be wrong about

Gutted → 16 tests still green. Every reference in `tests/` was a string in an
alias list, an entry in the eval-battery harness, or a routing docstring. The
one test with `delay_analysis` in its name calls the *parser* and asserts
`isinstance(..., list)`.

This is the EOT / prolongation path: its output feeds a claim value and an
expert report. A version silently returning zeros would have produced a
confidently empty claim — understating entitlement, which is the expensive
direction.

The new tests are anchored on a **metamorphic property** rather than a golden
number: a programme analysed against *itself* must show zero net delay and an
unchanged critical path. That holds whichever baseline is used, so it does not
rot when fixtures change, and a stub cannot reach zero honestly without parsing
both files and differencing them. The reconciliation test is the same shape:
the compensable / non-compensable and excusable / non-excusable buckets must
*sum to the input count*, not merely exist.

---

## The cross-cutting failure: the router surface

This is where the audit found real defects rather than missing tests.

### Three actions the router could not dispatch

`generate_construction_report`, `extract_measurements` and `track_progress`
were fully-written public actions with no entry in the handlers table. One was
user-facing: `_suggest_next_action` recommends `generate_construction_report`
**by name** after a QA/QC run with defects, and dispatching that suggestion
returned `"Unknown action"`. The platform recommended something it then
refused to run.

### Wiring them, as first attempted, was wrong — they could not run

The first attempt routed all three. That was wrong, and the reason matters:
**unreachable code is often unreachable because it does not work.**

    generate_construction_report -> self._generate_doc_recommendations
    track_progress               -> self._assess_delay_risk
      (via _compare_photo_to_bim -> self._element_similarity,
                                 -> self._find_deviations)

None of those four helpers had ever been defined in this repository —
`git log -S "def <helper>" --all` returned nothing for all four. Measured
through `route()`:

| Action | Result |
|---|---|
| `track_progress` | `AttributeError: _assess_delay_risk` |
| `track_progress` (with photos) | `AttributeError: _find_deviations` |
| `generate_construction_report` | `KeyError: 'doc_type'` |
| `extract_measurements` | `{"status": "success", ...}` — runs |

So routing them converted an honest refusal into an unhandled 500.

**Correction to an earlier claim in this document.** It initially said
`generate_construction_report` reads five keys `process_document` does not
return, and was therefore written against an older contract. That was based on
a probe using a specification `.txt`. `process_document` dispatches by document
type, and the *drawing* branch does return all five — `doc_type`,
`detected_disciplines`, `total_pages`, `measurements`, `tables`. The action
worked for drawings and raised `KeyError` for every specification, report and
contract. The unconditional break was only `_generate_doc_recommendations`.

`extract_measurements` is not a twin of `extract_quantities`, which was the
other possibility worth ruling out: it reads a drawing and produces
measurements, while `extract_quantities` consumes a measurements *list*. They
are consecutive pipeline stages.

### Then all three were implemented and wired

The actions were briefly parked and registered. That was reversed on
instruction, and implementing them surfaced three further defects in the same
chain that parking would have preserved:

- **`_query_bim_location` read the wrong key.** It took
  `result["elements"]`; `BIMExtractorBlock` returns `building_elements`. Every
  model query resolved to `[]`, so every photograph was compared against an
  empty model and matched nothing.
- **It advertised a query the block does not implement.** It passed
  `action: "query_location"`, and `BIMExtractorBlock.process()` does not branch
  on `action` at all. The location filter had never run. Filtering is now done
  in the container by text match against element fields, and is documented as
  text matching — the extractor emits no storey or space reference per element,
  so there is nothing to do geometric containment against.
- **A plural defeated the matcher by one hundredth.** An element tokenises to
  `{wall, walls}` (category is plural, `ifc_type` is not); a detected `wall`
  tokenises to `{wall}`. Jaccard 0.5, fuzzy ratio 0.571, against the caller's
  0.6 threshold. Every wall in every model was missed.

Measured end to end after the fixes, on `sample_office.ifc` and two real site
photographs with a stub detector: **27 model elements resolved, 9 identified,
18 not identified, 1 unmodelled object** (an excavator, similarity 0.4)
reported as a deviation.

`_element_similarity` is deliberately generic text similarity — token overlap
against fuzzy ratio — not a construction-weighted heuristic. Nothing in the
repo measures how well a vision label maps to an IFC class, so a domain-tuned
score would be a guess presented as a measurement.

### The confident zero

The most dangerous defect in this chain was not a crash. With no image block
wired, `_compare_photo_to_bim` returned `detected = []`, which flowed through
as *"0% progress, high delay risk"* with `status: "success"` — a finding that
nothing has been built, manufactured out of a missing dependency, and
indistinguishable on screen from a real one.

Detection now records **whether it ran**, not just what it returned, and
`track_progress` refuses on all three empty inputs — no photographs, no
resolvable model elements, no analysable photograph — rather than returning a
number. `_assess_delay_risk` answers `not_assessed` rather than `low` when it
has nothing to measure, because `low` is the answer a reader acts on.

### The fence, and proof that it bites

`tests/test_construction_actions_reachable.py` closes three directions:

- **FORWARD** — every name a dispatch surface emits (`_suggest_next_action`,
  `auto_pipeline` `next_actions[]`, `cm_step_aliases.STEP_TO_TARGET`) is a
  handlers **key**, and `route()` really accepts it.
- **REVERSE** — every handlers key is named by some caller surface, asserted as
  **equality** against a documented externally-called set. A new orphan fails,
  *and* an entry that stops being an orphan fails. An allowlist would rot
  silently in one direction; equality rots in neither.
- **RUNNABLE** — no method calls a `self.<helper>` that does not exist,
  followed **transitively** up the call graph, plus one rule with no
  exceptions: *parking broken code is allowed, routing it is not.*

Verified by breaking the container five ways. Each turned the fence RED; each
restore returned it to GREEN:

| Mutation | Test that fired |
|---|---|
| un-wire a working action | `every_public_action_is_routable` + reverse reachability |
| route a parked broken action | `no_unrunnable_method_is_routed` |
| add a 5th phantom helper to a *working* method | `no_new_method_calls_a_helper_that_does_not_exist` |
| define one of the four phantom helpers | `no_new_method_calls_a_helper_that_does_not_exist` |
| add an orphan action nothing can name | `every_dispatchable_action_is_named_by_some_surface` |

Note the fourth row: defining `_assess_delay_risk` did **not** un-park
`track_progress`, because it still depends on two more phantom helpers one
level down. The transitive closure is load-bearing, not decoration.

Two namespaces matter throughout. The handlers table aliases on purpose
(`"schedule_risk": self.analyze_schedule_risk`), so the **keys** are what
callers name and the `self.<method>` targets are what the class defines.
Checks that mix them report false positives — a mistake made once during this
audit, and now called out in the test file so it is not repeated.

### A false-green machine (bar 2)

`tests/test_cm_step_aliases.py` validated `STEP_TO_TARGET` against
`_KNOWN_CONSTRUCTION_ACTIONS` — a hand-maintained literal set of thirty route
keys. It was checking the alias table against its own copy of the router
rather than against the router.

Proven, not asserted: deleting `"schedule_risk": self.analyze_schedule_risk`
from the handlers table leaves `STEP_TO_TARGET["recovery_options"] ->
("construction", "schedule_risk")` dangling, and that file stayed **GREEN**.
It is now derived from the handlers table and goes RED on the same mutation.

### A placeholder value (bar 1)

`extract_measurements` returned
`result.get("confidence", {}).get("measurement_extraction", 0)`.
`measurement_extraction` is computed nowhere — that line is its only occurrence
in the codebase — so every successful extraction reported **confidence 0**. A
reader cannot distinguish "the extractor is not sure" from "nobody computes
this", and the first reading is the one a user acts on.

Now `None`, with an assertion that a bare `0` cannot come back.

---

## The delegation cluster — QTO, formulas, orchestration

Ten container actions are pure pass-throughs: resolve a block by name, refuse
honestly if it is absent, otherwise `await block.process(input_data, params)`.
There is no arithmetic to get wrong, so control-deleting the body says little.

Coverage was close to nothing. **`formula_execute` and `orchestrate` were
referenced by no test in the repository** except the router fence written
during this audit; `sympy_reason` and `bim_extract` had one file each.

Two things can be wrong in a delegation, and both are silent:

1. **The block name drifts.** `_resolve_block("formula_executor_v3")` returns
   None and the action answers `"block unavailable"` — which reads as a
   profile or deployment problem, not a bug, so it survives review.
2. **It stops delegating.** Nothing downstream notices if the action returns
   its own shaped dict instead of the block's answer.

`tests/test_container_delegations.py` covers both. All 17 block names the
container resolves were checked against `BLOCK_REGISTRY` — **0 unknown**, a
genuine bar 2 pass rather than an assumed one.

### A check that excluded what breaks it

The first version guarded the parser with `len(delegations) >= 6`. That did
not bite, and the reason is worth recording. `_pure_delegations()` recognises
a delegation *by its shape*, so gutting one to `return {"status": "success"}`
stops it matching the pattern and it drops silently out of the set the tests
iterate. The guard excluded precisely the mutation it existed to catch.

Replaced with an equality assertion against the pinned set. Re-verified:

| Mutation | Result |
|---|---|
| typo in a block name | 3 failed |
| a delegation stops delegating | 1 failed |
| delegation re-pointed at a different block | 2 failed |

### An invariant that turned out to be false

"No delegation returns success on empty input" was written, failed, and was
**removed rather than given an exception list**. `learn` legitimately succeeds
with no input: `learning_engine` is a query reporting current state, and zero
formulas is the true answer, not a fabricated one. The invariant is real per
block but not across all of them. An exception list would have converted a
false generalisation into a permanent stale twin.

---

## Bar 1 sweep — flattering defaults

The `confidence` defect has a detectable signature: `.get("key", <literal>)`
where `"key"` is never *produced* anywhere. Run across the container package
that pattern hits 59 times. Most are legitimate — they read caller-supplied
input, and a default is the right behaviour there.

The dangerous subclass is where the default is a **flattering** value, so the
absence of data reads as a good result. Two of those, both confirmed by
grepping for a producer across all of `app/`:

**`procurement_optimizer` scores every supplier identically, from nothing.**
`boq.py:1787-1792` defaults six supplier scores to `70 / 75 / 80 / 80 / 60 /
70`. Nothing in `app/` produces `price_score`, `delivery_score`,
`quality_score`, `financial_score`, `esg_score` or `support_score`. Unless an
API caller hand-supplies them, every supplier scores exactly **73.8**, and the
action then presents a weighted ranking and a recommended supplier off numbers
nobody measured. A tie is not the visible outcome — a confident ordering is.

**Fixed**, not registered: unscored suppliers now carry `total_score: None`
and a `scoring_basis` naming the gap, scored suppliers are re-normalised over
the criteria actually supplied, and unscored ones sort last rather than being
coerced to `0` (which would read as "assessed and terrible"). The downstream
average in `_generate_procurement_insights` skips them rather than emitting a
re-tender recommendation caused by missing data.

### A false positive from this sweep, recorded deliberately

The sweep also flagged `digital_twin_sync`: `_generate_sync_recommendations`
tests `quality.get("completeness_score", 100) < 80`, and `completeness_score`
did not appear in the produced-key set, which would have made the "add missing
geometry" recommendation unreachable and the sync report permanently clean.

**That finding was wrong.** `completeness_score` *is* produced, at
`__init__.py:1737` — but by subscript assignment
(`checks["completeness_score"] = ...`) rather than as a dict literal, and the
sweep's `"key":` regex only sees literals. The recommendation is reachable and
the action is not defective.

It is written up here rather than deleted because the failure mode is
reusable: a static producer-set built from dict literals under-reports, so
every hit from this sweep needs a plain grep for the key name before it counts
as a finding. The `procurement_optimizer` hit survived exactly that check.

---

## The agents subsystem

Audited on the same three bars after the container work, on the instruction
"fix the imports and audit the agents".

### The imports: a feature unreachable from its own package

`app/agents/catalog.py` did `from models import AgentManifest`, and
`activation.py` did `from catalog import ...`. That is Python-2
implicit-relative syntax; under Python 3 it resolves only if `app/agents` is
itself on `sys.path`. So:

```
>>> import app.agents.catalog
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'models'
```

No application code could reach the discipline hats at all. Three imports were
corrected to full `app.agents.*` paths.

The instructive part is the coverage picture. These modules had **33 passing
tests**. They passed because the test files did `sys.path.insert(0,
"app/agents")` first — which also meant tests and application would have loaded
`models` and `app.agents.models` as two distinct module objects, where a
pydantic class from one fails `isinstance` against the identical class from the
other. The tests were not merely failing to catch the break; their setup was
what concealed it. Six test files carried the hack and all six were cleaned.

Fenced by `tests/test_no_implicit_relative_imports.py`: a static AST sweep over
all of `app/` for siblings imported as top-level, a real package-path import of
every `app.agents` module, and a module-identity assertion that fails if
anything reintroduces the dual-module hazard.

> **Correction recorded.** These modules were first called "dead". They were
> not — they were unreachable from the package while being well tested through
> a path that bypassed it. Unreachable and untested are different findings and
> conflating them overstates the damage.

### Bar 3 across `runtime.py`

A systematic AST-based control-delete over the largest methods:

| Method | Lines | Gutted → | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| `_run_tool_call` | — | 13 failed | pass |
| `chat` | — | 14 failed | pass |
| `_chat_stream_impl` | — | 7 failed | pass |
| `chat_stream` | — | 7 failed | pass |
| `_build_sources_from_audit` | — | 4 failed | pass |
| `select_agent_for_message` | — | 3 failed | pass |
| `tool_definitions` | — | 3 failed | pass |
| `_call_llm` | 305 | **150 passed** | **FAIL** |
| `_stream_synthesis` | 139 | **150 passed** | **FAIL** |
| `_build_exports_from_audit` | 103 | **150 passed** | **FAIL** |
| `_apply_rag_context` | 86 | **150 passed** | **FAIL** |
| `_auto_validate` | 69 | **150 passed** | **FAIL** |

A better record than the container's, and one clear pattern in the failures.

### Coverage that reads as its own opposite

`_call_llm` is referenced by 23 test files and **65 of those references are
mocks of it**. It is the most-mocked function in the repository and was the
least tested: every one of those tests asserts what happens *after* it returns.
Its own logic — provider fallback, per-attempt `tool_choice` and temperature,
Groq `tool_use_failed` recovery, the soft daily cap — had no detection at all.

This is worth stating as a general rule, because it inverts the usual reading:
**a heavily-mocked function is a coverage risk, not a covered one.** The mock
count measures how many tests need it out of the way, not how many check it.

`_auto_validate` was the opposite extreme — **zero references anywhere** — and
it is the middleware that runs the validation pipeline over every numeric a
tool returns and attaches the verdict the LLM is instructed to obey ("refuse to
report any number whose check shows overall=fail"). On a platform whose product
is numbers, nothing could detect it silently stopping.

All five now have payload tests, mocked at the transport boundary
(`httpx.AsyncClient.post` / `.stream`) rather than at the function, so the
logic under test actually runs. Batched control-delete of the four largest:
**67 of 78 failed**. The 11 survivors are the negative tests, which correctly
still pass against a `[]` / `False` stub and are each paired with a positive
test that failed.

### Both directions, again

The container audit's lesson held here. Every fence in this section pins two
sides:

- A retryable status (408/413/429/5xx/timeout) must fall back **and** a
  non-retryable one (400/401/403/404) must not. A one-sided check permits a
  fallback that burns the second provider's quota on a bad API key.
- The RAG calculation directive must fire **and** must not carry the
  strict-grounding wording. That wording was observed live refusing to multiply
  25 × 18 × 1.2 — the model was not failing, it was obeying.
- `_build_exports_from_audit` must produce the offer when data backs it **and**
  withhold it when not. `[]` is that function's flattering default and its own
  honest answer for most turns, which makes `return []` an unusually good
  disguise.

### The agent tool surface

The direct analogue of the container's router fence:
`tests/test_agent_tool_surface.py` asserts that every tool an agent advertises
in `tool_definitions()` is a name `_run_tool_call` can dispatch. Result: **14
live agents, 0 undispatchable tools.**

> **Correction recorded.** An earlier pass of this reported *all 14 agents
> broken*. It checked advertised tools against a set of three synthetic names
> taken from a docstring; `list_project_documents`, `fetch_document` and
> `construction_calc` are all dispatched (`runtime.py:4512, 4555, 4712`) and the
> docstring was simply incomplete. The fence now parses the dispatcher itself.
> This is the fourth finding in this audit produced by checking against a
> hand-written surface list, and the reason every fence here derives its
> surface from code.

### A second, dormant agent system

There are two agent systems and only one runs. Alongside the live 14,
`app/agents/manifests/fork.*.json` declares a base plus five discipline hats,
gated behind `FORK_HATS_ENABLED`. `runtime.py` contains **zero** references to
`allowed_actions`, and **32 of the 35** plain action names the manifests declare
resolve to no block, no route key and no synthetic tool.

So the flag is not an on-switch for five disciplines; flipping it grants agents
permission to call 32 actions that do not exist. Registered in
`KNOWN_INCOMPLETE.md` rather than implemented — writing those 32 is building a
feature, which is outside "fix what fails a bar".

`tests/test_hats_are_dormant.py` holds the conditional invariant: while the flag
is off the gap is reported and skipped, and the moment it is on every declared
action must be dispatchable. Deliberately not "32 actions are undispatchable",
which would pin the defect in place and go red the moment someone fixed one.
Verified to bite by setting the flag: 2 failed, naming each manifest and its
missing actions.

> **Corrections recorded.** Two further claims from this sweep were wrong and
> withdrawn before being reported as fact: "3 missing calculators" (`formulas.py`
> has a third namespace, `app.core.construction_knowledge`, carrying all three —
> all 20 resolve), and "32 unresolved actions" attributed to the *live* system
> (they belong to the dormant one). A sweep that checked every class against
> `Agent` also produced a bogus "9 unresolved" and was discarded.

---

## Stated limitations

**`extract_measurements` extracts counts, not dimensions.** On the real drawing
fixture all 34 measurements come back as `type: "count"`, `unit: "ea"`. No
lengths, areas or volumes are recovered from a construction drawing. This is
consistent with the previously-registered drawing-precision finding and is a
drawing-reader problem, not a ranking or wiring one. The action is real and
useful for schedules of items; it is not a quantity take-off.

**`ACTION_HINTS` contains five entries no producer emits** —
`design_review_workflow`, `handover_management`, `inspection_request`,
`ncr_management`, `rfi_management` do not appear in `smart_orchestrator`. They
are inert (unmatched hints fall through to plain chat), so they are not fenced,
but they are dead vocabulary.

**The archive was not rewritten.** `docs/archive/HANDOFF.md` and
`PROGRESS.md` still carry the incorrect "need multi-file resolution" reason.
They are historical records; `KNOWN_INCOMPLETE.md` names and corrects them
rather than editing history.

---

## Still pending

- Bar 1 lying-return sweep across the remaining capabilities. The sweep method
  is written up above, including its false-positive mode (keys assigned by
  subscript are invisible to a dict-literal producer set, so every hit needs a
  plain grep before it counts).
- Real-file validation for BOQ and QTO, matching the standard
  `parse_primavera_schedule` already meets. BOQ and QTO are currently proven
  on synthetic fixtures; drawings and schedules are proven on real ones.
- `extract_measurements` recovers counts but no dimensions from a real
  drawing (all 34 hits are `type: "count"`, `unit: "ea"`). That is a
  drawing-reader limitation, registered, not a wiring one.
- Two committed binaries used as fixtures (`drawing_tm_200.pdf`,
  `ohdd_baseline_2013.xer`) are pending an owner decision on client content.
  Both payload test files now assert their presence in the production-like CI
  profile, so purging one breaks the build instead of silently returning the
  capability to zero coverage as green skips.
- The discipline-hat system needs a product decision, not code. It overlaps
  heavily with the live 14-agent system and the agent-picker, and closing it
  means writing 32 actions. Registered and fenced; nothing here is blocked on
  it.
- `_call_llm`'s fallback ladder is now covered at the transport boundary, but
  no test exercises a real provider. The live behaviour of Groq's free-tier
  413 above ~12k tokens is documented in `render.yaml`, not asserted — it
  cannot be, without spending on the account it describes.
