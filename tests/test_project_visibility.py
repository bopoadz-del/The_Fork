"""PR D — project visibility model + RAG project-scope safety.

Visibility model under test:
  * Admin → sees every project.
  * Non-admin → sees own projects + admin-approved platform projects;
                other users' personal projects stay hidden;
                is_approved=False rows stay owner-only.
  * Mutating endpoints (POST/DELETE on a project) remain owner-only.

RAG retriever:
  * retrieve_with_filter must reject empty project_id.
  * store.search must scope strictly to the requested project_id —
    no chunk from another project ever bleeds across.
