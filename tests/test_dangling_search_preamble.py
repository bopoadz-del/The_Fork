"""A promise to search is never a final answer - for ANY question type.
Live WAVE-2 re-smoke (2026-08-31, e6c250e): D1 and E1 both ended on a bare
promise and the user saw it as the answer. Two independent defects:
1. _final_text_needs_forced_retry only forced the no-tools retry for
document-deliverable or generative requests, so plain factual lookups fell
straight through.
2. _SEARCH_PREAMBLE_RE only matched "let me" / "I'll" openers, missing
"I'm searching ...", "I am running a targeted search ...", and "I need to
run the corrected tool call first".
Pinned here with the verbatim live strings.
