"""The upload contract a browser actually experiences.

THE DEFECT THIS PINS
--------------------
The chat composer reported "Upload error: Failed to fetch" — the browser's
message for a request that never produced a readable HTTP response. Three
things made that reachable, none of them covered by any test:

1. Two upload routes carried DIFFERENT size caps (10 MB vs 50 MB) and
   DIFFERENT extension allowlists, so "what the product accepts" depended on
   which route the caller hit.
2. An oversize upload was accepted in full — the entire body spooled to disk —
   and only then answered 413. For a 345 MB corpus PDF that is minutes of
   transfer, and any proxy timeout in between becomes a connection reset, which
   the browser reports as "Failed to fetch".
3. CORSMiddleware was registered FIRST, which in Starlette makes it INNERMOST.
   Every response produced by an outer middleware (rate-limit 429s, oversize
   413s) therefore reached the browser with no CORS headers — unreadable, and
   indistinguishable from the server being down.

The old tests called ``upload_v1()`` as a plain Python function with the store
monkeypatched, so none of this was observable: no HTTP, no middleware, no
headers, no disk.
