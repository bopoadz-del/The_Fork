"""The platform's own context must never come back out as an answer.

Live on 554e0b9, theshovel.ai / Master Corpus, fresh thread, asking for the
Delay Damages daily rate. The turn ran 564 seconds, routed to ``generate_wbs``,
and streamed the pre-dispatch payload to the user AS THE ANSWER. It opened:

    {"status": "success", "wbs_id": "wbs-ccc4ee6c", "project_type": "building",
     "brief": "AUTHORITATIVE REFERENCE CONTEXT - the material below was
     retrieved from the project corpus ...

and closed with the instruction the platform had written for the model
("Report the new durations ... Do not re-call generate_wbs"). In between: the
entire retrieval brief, per-excerpt ``[doc_id= chunk= score=]`` telemetry, and
the customer's absolute local paths -- ``G:\\My Drive\\Master Folder\\the
project\\Contract Docs\\Contractor\\Contract docs NOT SIGNED\\...``.

Nothing caught it. Every branch of ``_is_tool_call_obj`` recognises a tool
CALL; a tool RESULT matches none of them. These tests pin the result shape,
each of the four brief markers, and the excerpt telemetry -- at the sanitiser
chokepoint and on the streaming path, because the answer travels both.
