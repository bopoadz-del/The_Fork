"""A failed turn must leave a trace in the conversation, not a silent gap.

LIVE 2026-08-02, operator's own thread (project Chad):

    user:      "DG2 package 1"
    assistant: <nothing — ever>
    user:      "Backfilling specification"

Two consecutive user turns with no reply between them. Not a rendering
glitch: `append_message(conversation_id, "user", ...)` runs BEFORE the LLM
call, while the assistant message is appended only on the SUCCESS paths. The
UI's error bubble is local React state, so it vanishes on reload — leaving a
question that looks ignored, with nothing to indicate a failure happened.

The feature sweep reproduced the mechanism independently: `document_metadata`
returned `kimi HTTP 400: "tokenization failed"` -> error event -> nothing
persisted.

This is worse than a wrong answer. A wrong answer can be challenged; a
missing one reads as the platform having chosen not to respond.
