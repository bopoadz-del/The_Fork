    612a2d89 (#436) is the standing hole: required checks `pip-audit` and
    `test-postgres` went red on main while Render auto-deploy was still
    on-commit, so a red SHA could already be live.

    The gate is Render's native `autoDeployTrigger: checksPass` ("After CI
    Checks Pass"). Render waits for this SHA's GitHub check runs and skips
    the deploy if any conclusion is a failure or if zero checks are
    detected. success / neutral / skipped all count as passed.

    Deprecated `autoDeploy: true` is equivalent to `commit` (no CI gate).
    If both keys are present, `autoDeployTrigger` wins — so a leftover
    `autoDeploy: true` next to `checksPass` is harmless, but a lone
    `autoDeploy: true` (or `autoDeployTrigger: commit`) re-opens the hole.
    Pin the trigger and reject the on-commit forms.

    This file does not change the running service until Dashboard
    Auto-Deploy is set to "After CI Checks Pass" (prefer that one toggle)
    or the blueprint is applied. The test pins the intended live value so
    Apply Blueprint cannot silently revert to on-commit.
