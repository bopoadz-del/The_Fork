"""A filename keyword must match a WORD, not a substring.

Live-fire phase 3, T5: a real Work Inspection Request --
"MRH-QMS-C-01(02) Work Inspection Request (WIR).xlsx" -- classified as
`specification`, because the keyword "spec" matched INSIDE the word
"In-spec-tion". Every inspection document in the operator's QMS (WIRs,
inspection procedures, inspection reports) would misfile as a spec.

Mechanism: `classify` used bare substring membership (`kw in filename`).
Now keywords match at word boundaries, with hyphen/underscore/parenthesis
treated as separators since real controlled-document names are full of them.

Also registers the QA/QC types the operator's QMS actually uses -- NCR, WIR,
ITP, MAR/MIR submittals -- so those documents classify to their own type
instead of leaning on generic 'report'.
