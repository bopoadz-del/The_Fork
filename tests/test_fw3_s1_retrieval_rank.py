"""S1 pre-answer ranking: the specification-class lift must not bury the cover.

Live probe (d708b5d, POST /v1/rag/search, k=50) for

    Per the project specification, what is the minimum concrete cover
    to reinforcement for foundations?

put Vol 5 Other Documents (4 of 5) chunk 92 at rank 22 (score ~3.26).
Ranks 1–12 were Vol 2 Specification chunks at a flat ~3.70–3.77. Chat
injection (``rag_inject`` → ``retrieve_with_filter``, k=5) never passed
chunk 92 to the model.

The flat gap is the specification filename lift stacked on a cover
detector that treats any "cover" plus any millimetre in the same chunk
as a stated cover length. Bollard bands and raised-floor panels then
outrank the durability sentence ("nominal cover … 50mm … blinding …
75mm … casted against soil").

Signed and unsigned copies of that same sentence also take two slots.

Fixtures are prefixed ``FIXTURE-e-20260926-``. Clause text is a short
mirror of the quoted sentences only. No live ids in the assertions.
