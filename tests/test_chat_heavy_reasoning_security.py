"""Heavy-reasoning route tenancy + conversation isolation.

Regression for the two Codex P1 findings on the merged PR #18:

  1. `_stream_from_heavy_reasoning` passes `project_id` to the runtime
     agent without an ownership check, so an authenticated user can
     pull another tenant's indexed docs via the agent's
     `search_project_documents` tool.

  2. The same function keyed the agent's `conversation_id` only on
     `session_id`, which defaults to "default" on the calling path.
     Two users on the default session both write to `hr-default` in
     `agent_memory` → user B sees user A's prior turns.

Both fixes live in `app/routers/chat.py::_stream_from_heavy_reasoning`:
- Drop `project_id` (set to None) when the caller doesn't own it
- Prefix `conversation_id` with the user_id so per-user state stays
  per-user even on the default session
