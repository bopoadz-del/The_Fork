"""The cost gate's user closure is seeded by the OPERATOR, not the platform.

The runtime replays tool output into the conversation as user-role bubbles
("PLATFORM PRE-DISPATCH: ...", "Tool result (boq_processor): ...") and folds
retrieved chunks into the last user turn. Seeding the user-arithmetic closure
from every user-role message therefore treated a whole priced BOQ -- every
quantity, rate and amount a block returned -- as figures the operator had
typed. Two consequences, one test group each below:

  * the gate grounded numbers it exists to refuse (its own rule is "a rate
    the user never typed still fails the gate");
  * the closure was seeded with hundreds of figures and grew past 2 GiB,
    which OOM-killed the live web instance on 21 Sep 2026 (#692).

Synthetic figures throughout.
