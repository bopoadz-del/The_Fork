"""A question carrying its own numbers is arithmetic, not a document lookup.

LIVE 2026-08-03, project-assistant on the master corpus:

    "Calculate the concrete volume for a raft 25m x 18m x 1.2m thick and
     the number of 6m3 truck loads"

    -> route None (below_routing_gate), construction_calc never invoked:
       "I cannot find that specific information in the provided reference
        context ... they do not contain a raft measuring 25 m x 18 m x 1.2 m
        thick, nor any reference to 6 m3 truck loads. Consequently, I cannot
        calculate the requested concrete volume or number of truck loads."

25 x 18 x 1.2 = 540 m3; 540 / 6 = 90 loads. Nothing needed retrieving. The
grounding discipline overrode arithmetic and refused a question whose every
input was supplied in the question itself.

`concrete_volume` and `guardrail_top_rail_height` both EXIST (76 calculators
are registered) — _INTENT_TOOL_MAP's ~22 phrases simply never reach them.

The guard detects the SHAPE instead of chasing 76 keyword spellings: a calc
verb plus >=2 measurement-bearing numbers. Document lookups have neither.
