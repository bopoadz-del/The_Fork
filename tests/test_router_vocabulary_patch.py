"""TASK 1 vocabulary patch: the pilot-critical phrasings that missed at
confidence 0.0 in the 2026-07-06 feature-matrix sweep must route.

Source of truth: the routing-miss evidence log (DECISIONS.md) - verbatim
engineer phrasings from FEATURE_MATRIX.md's 20 class-1 misses. The patch is
ADDITIVE keyword vocabulary only; thresholds and matcher logic unchanged.
Two scoring facts these cases depend on (see _match_actions):

* a single-word keyword scores 0.2, below the 0.3 non-generative gate -
  which is why multi-word phrases were added rather than bare words;
* keyword matching is word-boundary exact, so plurals never matched their
  singular keyword ("drawings" vs "drawing").

If one of these starts failing, the router vocabulary regressed for a
feature the pilot demos.
