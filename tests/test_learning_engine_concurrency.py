"""Concurrency regression for LearningEngineBlock.shared_instance().

Before the singleton + per-instance state lock landed (PRs #19-#23 retro),
each smart_orchestrator dispatch and each /v1/feedback/route POST instantiated
a fresh LearningEngineBlock — full JSON _load_state on construction, full
JSON _save_state on every _record_pattern. Concurrent writes raced on the
file write: two threads would both serialise + write _state and the later
arrival silently clobbered the earlier one's bucket changes.

These tests prove (a) the lock prevents row loss under concurrent writes,
and (b) the path-keyed cache rebinds when LEARNING_ENGINE_STORAGE changes.

Establishes the first asyncio.gather + asyncio.to_thread pattern in tests/
since _record_pattern is sync — to_thread gives us real OS-thread
concurrency, not just event-loop coroutines that never actually run in
parallel on a CPython single-threaded interpreter.
