"""Chat sessions are per project and per owner.

Opening a project must not resume another thread: a new conversation id
returns none of an older thread's messages. The sidebar lists only the
caller's sessions on that project, newest first, including a session whose
row was stored before a project id was known. Another user who can open
the same project does not see them. The owner can rename a session; the
name is stored, length-limited, and cannot contain HTML.
