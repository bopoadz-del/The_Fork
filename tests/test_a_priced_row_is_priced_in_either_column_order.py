"""Rate and quantity on the row means there is an amount. In either order.

Live d8d9573, master_corpus, 0/5:

    "What is the amount for removal of existing chain link fence (D549.2)?"

    -> "the chain link fence item (D549.2) is **not priced** in the sources
        shown -- it appears as a rate-only or excluded item"

The row was retrieved at rank 1, and it reads:

    G | Breakout and remove existing chain link fence  D549.2  m  3,504
        80.00  280,320.00
    H | Breakout and remove existing storm water culverts  D529.3  m
        1,370.00  Rate Only

Owner's ruling on this exact item: "rate only is when you have no quantity;
if you have rate and quantity, you must have an amount."

A deterministic composer exists to state such a row without asking the model
to read it (WAVE 2 B5). It parsed nothing, so the model read the row itself
and attached the NEIGHBOUR's "Rate Only" to the fence. The parser expected

    <qty> <unit> <rate> <amount>        3,504 m 80.00 280,320.00

and a CESMM bill prints its columns  Ref | Unit | Qty | Rate | Amount:

    <unit> <qty> <rate> <amount>        m 3,504 80.00 280,320.00

Accepting the second order is safe for the same reason the first is: a triple
only counts when qty x rate equals the printed amount.
