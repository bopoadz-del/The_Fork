"""Every agent carries its discipline kernels; the orchestrator carries all.

Operator directives 2026-08-15: "we created few kernels for construction --
if they dont exist, create kernels for each", "each agent should has his own
kernels", "the orchestrator should have it all". The kernel system already
existed (app/agents/manifests/ hat manifests + catalog + activation adapter)
but was UNWIRED -- runtime.py never referenced it, so the manifests' formula
bindings, grounding policy, and discipline guidance influenced nothing.

The wiring is per-agent and load-time: a ``hats:`` frontmatter key binds an
agent to manifest ids (or ``all``); each hat's system_prompt_guidance is
merged into the agent's system prompt under a Discipline Kernels section and
the manifest's formula bindings are validated at load, so a manifest that
points at a missing implementation fails at boot, not mid-conversation.

Two hats were missing and are now real: quantities (take-off / BOQ
production) and safety (HSE engineering checks).
