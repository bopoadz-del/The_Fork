"""Tests for the smart-orchestrator → chat domain-hint integration (Fix #1).

The chat router now consults SmartOrchestratorBlock before invoking the chat
block. When the orchestrator finds a high-confidence intent match, a short
domain-aware sentence is prepended to the user message so the LLM answers
inside the right frame. When no match (or only weak matches), the message
flows through unchanged.

# can't silently route "what is the total cost" through the slow agent loop.
