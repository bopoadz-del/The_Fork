"""smart_orchestrator 1.1.0 — keyword-merge regression guards.

Pre-1.1.0 the matcher built ``ACTION_PATTERNS = PROCEDURE_ROUTING_ADDITIONS +
<smart_orchestrator's own list>`` then iterated with a ``seen_actions`` set
that SKIPPED any duplicate action name. PROCEDURE_ROUTING wins the action
name (it's prepended), so smart_orchestrator's keywords for the same action
silently never matched.

Six action names appear in both lists:

  - safety_compliance_audit
  - tender_bid_analysis
  - change_order_impact
  - commissioning_checklist
  - payment_certificate
  - risk_register_auto_populate   (all keywords overlap — no real gap)

These tests pick one previously-dropped keyword per affected action and
assert it routes after the 1.1.0 merge fix. Plus the static descriptor
checks: version bump, "52-action" label, deduplicated merged_patterns
count matches what we expect.
