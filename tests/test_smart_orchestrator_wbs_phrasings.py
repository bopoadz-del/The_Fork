"""PR #80 — per-action gate-1 threshold for GENERATIVE_INTENTS.

Pre-PR-#80 the matcher used a single 0.3 confidence_threshold for every
action. The operator brief's literal query ``"generate a WBS for a
10-floor tower"`` only hit the bare ``"wbs"`` keyword (1 word, 0.2
score) -- below the global gate, so generate_wbs never showed up in
matched_actions and needs_planning never fired.

PR #80 splits the gate by intent class: actions in GENERATIVE_INTENTS
(generate_wbs, bim_analysis, drawing_qto, ...) clear gate-1 at 0.2;
everything else stays at the historical 0.3 to suppress thin matches.

This test locks in:
  1. The literal "generate a WBS for X" phrasings reach matched_actions
     with action='generate_wbs' (so action_router can decide if they
     route).
  2. A non-generative action (boq_process is NOT in GENERATIVE_INTENTS)
     still requires 0.3 -- the relaxed gate does not leak.
  3. The bare "wbs" by itself still reports as generate_wbs candidate
     (no regression of the matcher's existing surface).

Note: needs_planning has a SEPARATE routing gate at 0.4
(ROUTING_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD in action_router.py). 0.2 scores reach
matched_actions but do NOT trigger the heavy-reasoning redirect on
their own -- they're surfaced so callers (e.g. the chat router's hint
path) can use them.
