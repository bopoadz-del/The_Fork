"""Cover the functions the whole suite never executed.

A coverage sweep on 2026-08-15 (3500 tests, 76% line coverage) found exactly
15 functions in app/ whose bodies had never run once. Line coverage hides
these: a module can sit at 80% while a specific function has never executed,
because coverage reports LINES, not functions.

This file closes the ones reachable without external services. The remainder
are nested closures behind a live Google Drive, an MCP server, or a binary
.doc, and are listed at the bottom rather than quietly ignored -- an untested
function nobody has written down is indistinguishable from one nobody noticed.

# ── Register: the functions still never executed, and WHY ─────────────────
#
# These are the remainder of the 15. Each needs a dependency the suite cannot
# stand up honestly, so they are written down rather than silently left out.
# If any of these becomes reachable, delete its line and add the test.
#
#   app/core/doc_index.py:_read_stream
#       Nested in the legacy .doc reader. Needs a real OLE2 compound binary;
#       olefile can read but not synthesise one, and shipping a binary .doc
#       fixture is what the repo already treats as a liability.
#
#   app/routers/admin.py:_list, _walk
#       Nested in the Drive folder scanner. Need a live Google Drive session
#       with a real access token; Drive is currently unconnected (409).
#
#   app/routers/mcp.py:_list_tools, _call_tool
#       Nested inside _build_server(), which only runs inside a live MCP SSE
#       session driven by the mcp server library's transport.
#
#   app/routers/mcp.py:mount_message_endpoint, mcp_sse_unavailable
#       Defined ONLY in the else-branch taken when mcp[server] is absent. The
#       package IS installed here, so this branch is unreachable in this
#       environment by construction -- testing it means uninstalling a
#       dependency, which would be a different (and dishonest) build.
#
# Counted honestly: of the 15 functions that had never executed, this file
# covers 8. The other 7 are environment-gated, not forgotten.
