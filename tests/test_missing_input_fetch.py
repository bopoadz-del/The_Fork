"""AN ANSWER THAT NAMES ITS MISSING INPUT GOES AND GETS IT (item 4).

F-E1-2, ``FLEET_OPS/artifacts/gate_battery_13b2bf7_2026-08-31.md``:

    E1 | FAIL | "do not state the specific monetary rate per calendar day".
    ...
    E1 and E2 together are the proof for F-E1-2. One question apart, same
    session, same corpus: E2 retrieved the Accepted Contract Amount to
    complete its arithmetic; E1 said the figure it needed was not available.
    It is not a retrieval limit. E1 identified its missing input and did not
    go and get it.

The battery questions here are the instrument's own strings, via the
sanitized catalog. The refusal texts are the recorded phrasing where the
pack records it (E1) and representative otherwise -- said plainly rather
than implied, because a fence written against a paraphrase proves nothing.

Each test names the mutation it kills.
