"""TERM EQUIVALENCE answer-mapping hint + its A9 leak guard.

Live gap (2026-09-13): the retriever surfaced the right Contract Data document
(DD-2023-118 Vol 1, High confidence) yet the model answered "I don't have the
contract sum before VAT" — it would not equate the everyday synonym with the
formal "Accepted Contract Amount". The synonym-expansion PR fixed RETENTION
(a genuine retrieval miss) but not this, because ACA was never a retrieval
problem in the chat path — it is answer mapping.

format_chunks_as_system_message now appends a TERM EQUIVALENCE note when the
question uses such a synonym. Like every routing note it is governed by the
INTERNAL GUIDANCE directive (never quoted), so it must (a) fire only on a
synonym, (b) never appear for a canonical-term question, and (c) be preceded by
INTERNAL GUIDANCE / NEVER quote so it cannot leak verbatim (the A9 failure mode).
