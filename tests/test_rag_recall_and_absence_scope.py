"""Retrieval must not report a corpus-wide absence it cannot see.

THE INCIDENT THIS REPRODUCES (2026-08-17)
-----------------------------------------
Turn 5, the assistant quoted from the project's structural general notes:

    "SBC 304 — Saudi Building Code, Concrete Structural"  (doc cd44bdd0, chunk 285)

Turn 8, asked "Saudi buiding code", it retrieved five unrelated excerpts
(cable ladders, LV single-line diagrams, fire alarm, water pipelines, road
alignment) and answered:

    "The five chunks supplied in this turn's reference context do not mention
     the Saudi Building Code at all."

Two independent defects, both pinned here:

* RECALL — the phrase is three ordinary words, so ``extract_query_identifiers``
  extracted nothing and no lexical pass ran at all; the turn was pure cosine
  over a 227-document corpus at k=5, and the user's typo ("buiding") degraded
  the lexical half of the hybrid search too.
* OVERCLAIM — "not in these five excerpts" was reported to the user as a fact
  about the corpus. Retrieved excerpts are evidence of presence, never of
  absence.

Why the existing e2e missed it: ``test_f3_grounded_citation`` retrieves k=5
over a TWO-chunk corpus. Retrieval over two chunks that returns five cannot
miss anything, so no recall defect is expressible in it.

These tests use the deterministic fake embedder, whose vectors are hashes and
therefore carry no semantic similarity at all. That is the point: it reproduces
a cosine miss exactly, so the only thing that can recover the document is the
lexical rescue.
