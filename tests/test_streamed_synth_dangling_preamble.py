"""A streamed answer that ends on a promise to search is not an answer either.

#454 taught the NON-streamed branch of ``_chat_stream_impl`` that a
first-person promise to search is a dead end, not a final answer. The
streamed-synthesis branch -- the one production actually takes, because
``SYNTHESIS_STREAMING`` is set on the-fork -- never learned it. It retried
only on an EMPTY stream, and a promise is not empty.

Measured live on ``1594b32``, with #454 AND #455 both deployed, in a fresh
thread on theshovel.ai / Master Corpus. Battery test D1, "Who is the
Engineer's Representative on this project?", ended on, verbatim:

    I don't have the Engineer's Representative's name in the retrieved
    excerpts. Let me search the Contract Data and Schedules volume more
    specifically for that appointment.

Nothing followed. ``_SEARCH_PROMISE_TAIL_RE`` matches that string, so the
non-streamed branch would have forced a retry. The streamed branch shipped
it as the answer.

Two branches, one rule, one implementation. These pin both halves: the
promise is never flushed to the client, and the retry runs.

Harness copied from test_synthesis_streaming.py -- a deliverable tool call
on the first _call_llm sets force_synthesis, and the next iteration takes
the streamed branch.
