"""Agent capability / self-introspection short-circuit.

Questions ABOUT the agent (its tools, abilities, accessible documents) must be
answered from the REAL tool roster + REAL document list, NOT from retrieved
document text. Regression guard for the live bug where "what tools do you have?"
returned construction power-tool specs (abrasive saw, diamond-core drill) from
the RAG corpus instead of the agent's actual software tools.
