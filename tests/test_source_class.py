"""AN EXCERPT MUST SAY WHAT KIND OF SOURCE IT IS (owner's numbered item 2).

Two failures in ``FLEET_OPS/artifacts/gate_battery_13b2bf7_2026-08-31.md``,
one cause. Both are quoted here verbatim from that pack:

    G1 | FAIL -- asserted Schedule 10 "sets out any applicable Works
    Guarantees" and quoted CONTRACT TEMPLATE wording. Expected: "Schedule
    10: Not Used", must not invent contents. It invented contents by
    importing a template.

    F-KB-1 -- generic knowledge displacing project retrieval (A5). The
    answer reproduces docs/knowledge/fidic_2017_administration.md almost
    verbatim ... instead of the project's own 0.1% at 8.8.1, which A7/E2
    show is retrievable. The knowledge base answered a question the corpus
    could answer better.

The battery questions are quoted from the instrument itself
(``UI-PHYS_DG2_results.xlsx``, column "Question (ask exactly)"), by way of
the sanitized catalog at ``tests/fixtures/ui_phys/questions.json`` which
carries the same strings. No paraphrase: a PASS obtained on a paraphrase is
not evidence about the battery question, which is F-PHRASE-1's whole point.

What this file can and cannot prove is worth stating, because the difference
is where the honest limit sits. It proves that the class is DERIVED
correctly, that it REACHES the model in the marker, that the precedence rule
is STATED when it can matter, and that the citation guard ENFORCES it. It
does not prove the model then obeys the instruction -- only the re-battery
on the deployed SHA can, and that is the next-but-one item in the order.
