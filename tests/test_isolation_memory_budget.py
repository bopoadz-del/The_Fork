"""The child's memory ceiling must be a BUDGET, not an absolute number.

This is the regression test for a bug that reached production and silently
emptied every document >= 1 MB.

``RLIMIT_AS`` caps VIRTUAL address space, and ``fork()`` gives the child a copy
of the parent's whole mapping. With torch and the embedding model resident the
parent's VmSize is already multiple GB, so setting an ABSOLUTE ceiling of
1536 MB was already breached at the moment the child started. The first
allocation raised MemoryError, ``_extract_pdf`` caught it via ``except
Exception`` and returned ``("", {})`` -- a *successful* empty extraction -- and
the document indexed as ZERO_CHUNK with nothing logged anywhere.

Observed live on 2026-08-21 after deploying the isolation change::

    doc-reindex d8c63ec7 (7.9 MB, 738 pages) -> ZERO_CHUNK in 0.42s
    fresh_extraction = {"total_chars": 0, "meta": {}}
    pdf_first_pages_chars = [357, 791, 540, 847, ... 6610, 6725]

The pages plainly had text. Two independent defects had to line up: a limit
that could never be satisfied, and a handler that turned the resulting error
into an empty file. Both are covered here.
