"""A calculator the ask names but gives no figures for asks for them by label.

Live (S4): an ask about a reference-table calculator was answered "the
pre-dispatch run errored: missing required points" and then refused. The
formula pre-dispatch handed the model the tool's raw bind error as an
"authoritative draft" of a run that had "ALREADY been run", followed by "No
registry calculator matched this question", although one had. The calculator's
own question for the input, by its label, sat unused in the envelope. Asks that
wrote the calculator's display name ("<display name> for 72 points") were not
recognised as naming it at all.

Generated from the registry, not known strings:

* an ask that writes a calculator's display name (three words or more) names
  that calculator and is a calculator ask;
* the pre-dispatch of a named calculator with no figures tells the model the
  calculator was not run and gives it the calculator's question; it is never
  told that no calculator matched, never handed the bind error, and never told
  the calculator already ran;
* an answer that only narrates the failed step, or copies the tool's error,
  leaves as that calculator's question;
* the platform's pre-dispatch wording never reaches the user;
* a whole turn with no figures ends on the question by label.
