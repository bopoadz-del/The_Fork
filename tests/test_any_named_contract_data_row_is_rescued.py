"""Any Contract Data row the question names is fetched -- not only five of them.

Live on b64bbd2, project master_corpus, three runs each, all 0/3:

    "What is the value of the Performance Bond?"
    "How many Milestones are there and what is the Time for Completion for
     Milestone 5?"
    "What is the approved method of electronic communication under the
     contract?"

Every answer was an honest "not in the retrieved excerpts". Every answer IS in
the corpus, in a correctly labelled ``CONTRACT DATA particulars`` chunk:

    4.3.3(a): | Value of Performance Bond: 10 % of the Accepted Contract Amount
    |: | | Milestone 5 | 731days from the date the Contractor is given ...
    electronic communication: Aconex

Asked WITH the words "Contract Data" in the question those chunks score 5.0
and take all five slots. Asked the way a person asks, they are not in the
result at all -- a volume's table-of-contents page and a drawing title block
win instead.

The cause is the shape of the rescue, not any one row. A scanned Contract
Data table embeds badly, so cosine never puts it in the candidate pool, and
every bonus downstream only re-scores what is already in the pool. The
out-of-pool fetch that fixes this existed -- for the Accepted Contract Amount,
Time for Completion, delay damages, the Defects Notification Period, the
Engineer, the Parent Company Guarantee and the Commencement Date. Seven rows,
each added after that row failed live. A Contract Data sheet has about sixty.

These tests pin the CLASS: a question that names a filled Contract Data row
gets that row, whichever row it is.
