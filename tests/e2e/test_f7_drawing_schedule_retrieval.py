"""F7 — a drawing's schedule must be RETRIEVABLE, not merely extractable.

This closes the limitation F6 left open and that KNOWN_INCOMPLETE.md recorded:
`_process_drawing` recovered bar schedules, but the RAG ingest path is a
different pipeline. `doc_index._extract_with_meta` pulls the PDF's raw text
layer, so a schedule reached the corpus as a flat run of words with its
row/column structure gone — "how many 16mm bars are on this sheet" was
unanswerable even though the figure was printed on the page.

The distinction this file exists to enforce: proving a helper RETURNS chunks
is not proving those chunks are retrievable. So these go through the real
`index_document` and then ask `retrieve_with_filter` for the value, the same
shape as F3. A test that stopped at the helper would have passed against the
old code path too, since the helper is new either way.
