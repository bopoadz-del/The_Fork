"""F2 — protected routes reject unauthenticated callers, valid ones pass.

The brief's rule 3 is the one that matters here: a gate must DENY on missing
or unknown context, never fall through to allow. So these tests do not only
check that a good key works — they check the three ways a gate fails OPEN:

  * no credential at all
  * a syntactically valid but unknown credential
  * a valid credential without the required role

A gate that reads a missing context as "allow" is a vulnerability, so each
of those must be a rejection, and the rejection must be an auth status
(401/403) rather than a 500 that happens to keep the caller out.
