"""An upload must reach the INDEX. Being queued is not being indexed.

Live-fire campaign, run 1 (2026-08-14): a document uploaded to the production
service returned HTTP 200 with ``indexed: true, indexing_status: "queued"`` and
then sat at ``chunk_count = 0`` forever. Asking about its contents produced
"I could not confirm this reference in the indexed project sources".

Mechanism: the arq ingest worker was removed from render.yaml on 2026-08-08 to
halve the compute bill, on the stated assumption that inline ingestion in the
web request would take over. It never did. ``upload_v1`` only falls back to
inline ``maybe_eager_index`` when ``enqueue_ingest()`` returns False, and that
only happened when Redis was unreachable — but Redis was deliberately KEPT for
sessions and rate limiting. So the enqueue always succeeded, the fallback never
ran, and nothing drained the queue.

The defect in one line: **"Redis is configured" was used as a proxy for "a
worker exists".** These are different facts, and the fence below keeps them
different. The existing tests in tests/test_ingest_queue.py check what
``enqueue_ingest`` RETURNS; these check where an uploaded document ENDS UP,
which is the property that actually broke.

Each test patches ``create_pool`` so Redis appears REACHABLE. That is what makes
the first test red on the old code: with a working queue the old branch takes
the enqueue path and schedules no inline work. A test that let Redis fail would
pass on the broken code and prove nothing.
