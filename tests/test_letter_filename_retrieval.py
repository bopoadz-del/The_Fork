"""D1: a named-site letter already in the corpus must be retrieved.

Live Master Corpus pack D1 (SHA 567147a / #480): the UBCC Concrete
Batching Plant at Wadi Safar letter was in Neon (ids 8199b14b,
b5033ec2) and the handover certificate was too (ae76492e). Retrieval
returned only Volume 5 Other Documents (geotech, plot agreement, weekly
reports) and the model refused — letter not in the excerpts.

Term rescue treated Volume 5's in-chunk place-name as "already
grounded" and skipped the out-of-pool fetch. The letter's FILENAME is
the discriminator Volume 5 cannot fake.

This fence uses the live letter filename shape and the live signatory
strings already pinned in ``tests/test_docx_signature_extraction.py``.
No new live client figures.
