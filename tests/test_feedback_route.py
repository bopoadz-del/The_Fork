"""Tests for the W4 feedback surface — POST /v1/feedback/route.

The contract this surface exists to honor:

1. A correction lands as a routing_decisions pattern on learning_engine,
   tagged corrected=True, source=user_correction.
2. The next train_router call with prefer_corrected=True picks it up
   and weights "auto" rows out of the training set.

These tests prove both ends of that contract — the route writes what
it claims to write, and the router can consume what the route writes.
