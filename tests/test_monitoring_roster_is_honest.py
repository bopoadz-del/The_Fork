"""The provider monitor may not report on providers the platform cannot call,
and may not diagnose an outage it has no data for.

Audit 2026-08-12. Found by reading a week of production logs while answering
"what is Groq still doing here?" -- the only Groq mention in seven days was a
boot banner:

    [monitoring] Monitoring Block initialized
       Tracking: ['deepseek', 'groq', 'openai', 'anthropic', 'local_ollama']

DeepSeek, OpenAI and Anthropic were removed from the platform on 2026-07-25.
`MonitoringBlock` still carried them, so `/v1/leaderboard` -- an admin endpoint
that goes on a client's desk -- listed three providers the deployment has no
key for and cannot reach.

The worse half was `/v1/recommend`. Nothing internal calls `record_call`; the
only writer is `POST /v1/metrics/record`, which nothing calls either. So every
provider has zero observations, no entry ever reaches the "use" threshold, and
the endpoint fell through to:

    {"recommended": "local_ollama", "confidence": 100.0,
     "reason": "All cloud providers degraded - using edge fallback",
     "emergency_mode": true}

A platform-wide provider outage, reported at full confidence, as the steady
state of a healthy system. That is the confident-zero pattern this audit keeps
finding: absence of data rendered as a diagnosis. An alarm that fires on every
call is how a real degradation gets ignored.

A prior audit (§8.6) already fixed the per-provider half of this -- zero-call
providers report `"unknown"` / `null` / `"unproven"` rather than the seeded
100%. What it did not fix was the aggregate verdicts built on top of them.
