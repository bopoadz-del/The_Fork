"""S1/S2 numeric requirements must come back from Other Documents.

Live SET5 on 7c0b255, fresh chats, project Master Corpus, 0/6:

* S1 — minimum concrete cover to reinforcement for foundations. Retrieval
  returned only Vol 2 Specification chunks (cross-reference "specified
  minimum concrete cover" / short cover as a rejection reason, Table 3-1
  C32/40). The durability sentence that states the cover in millimetres
  sits in Vol 5 Other Documents and never entered the retrieved set.
* S2 — compaction required under road pavement. Retrieval returned only
  Vol 2 Specification chunks ("all soils shall be properly compacted",
  BS 1377). The sub-grade sentence (percent of maximum dry density and a
  CBR figure) sits in Vol 5 Other Documents and never entered the set.

These tests run ``retrieve_with_filter`` on a real store. The ranking is
not mocked. Fixture ids and filenames are prefixed ``FIXTURE-e-20260925-``.
Synthetic text only.
