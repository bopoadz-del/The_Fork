"""Every tool an agent advertises must be one the runtime can dispatch.

Audit 2026-08-12, agents subsystem. The direct analogue of
tests/test_construction_actions_reachable.py, which found three container
actions the router could not reach.

An agent's `tool_definitions()` is what the LLM is shown and what it will
therefore try to call. `Agent._run_tool_call()` is what actually executes.
Nothing tied the two together, so a tool could be advertised and not
dispatchable -- the agent would emit a call the runtime rejects, and the model
would either loop or apologise to the user. That is the same failure the
container audit found, where `_suggest_next_action` recommended
`generate_construction_report` and `route()` answered "Unknown action".

Dispatchable names are read from the DISPATCHER, not from a hand-kept list.
An earlier pass of this audit checked advertised tools against an assumed set
of three synthetic names taken from a docstring and reported all 14 agents as
broken; `list_project_documents`, `fetch_document` and `construction_calc` are
all handled in `_run_tool_call` (runtime.py:4512, 4555, 4712) and the docstring
was simply incomplete. Deriving from the code is what makes the check true.
