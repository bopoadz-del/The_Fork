"""Tests for hybrid BM25 + vector retrieval in app/core/rag/vector_store.

Hand-crafted micro-corpus mirroring the failure modes from the live
drive_archive probe:

- 3 dense-repetition decoys ("Vol 3 Drawings legend" pattern) that
  semantic-only over-weights because their token cluster looks like the
  query.
- The actual answer chunks for Q2, Q4, Q5 — short, precise, with the
  exact tokens (e.g. "TL-600-0000002", "SECTIONAL ELEVATION",
  "MANHOLE TYPE-A SHALL BE PROVIDED AT EVERY 1000M") that BM25 will
  surface but semantic-only buries.
- A PRC-501 chunk for the Q3 regression check (must still rank top-2).
- Generic construction noise.

All tests use a real embedder (model2vec is the production default) and
a temp SQLAlchemy SQLite DB that's torn down per test. If no real
embedder backend is installed in this venv the fixture skips — the
hash-based fake embedder is too noisy to validate hybrid-beats-semantic
assertions.
