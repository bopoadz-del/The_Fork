"""A calculator's status must reflect whether it actually calculated.

Found by the 2026-08-15 all-76 calculator sweep. ``score_risk`` rejected
out-of-range inputs and returned {"error": "Probability and impact must each
be 1-5"} -- and ``run_calculation`` wrapped that in::

    {"status": "success", "result": {"error": "Probability and impact ..."}}

An error envelope inside a green one. Callers branch on ``status``, so the
agent tool loop read a refused calculation as a working answer.

Mechanism: ``run_calculation`` treated "did not raise" as "succeeded". But not
every calculator raises to signal failure -- several in
app/core/construction_knowledge.py validate inputs and RETURN an error dict.
The fix lives in run_calculation so all 76 are covered, rather than in the one
calculator the sweep happened to catch.

Fenced both ways: a real calculation must still report success, and a numeric
field named "error" (a tolerance or deviation, not a failure) must not be
mistaken for one.
