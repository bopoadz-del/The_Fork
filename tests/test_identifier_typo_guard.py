"""A typo must not be mistaken for a construction reference.

LIVE INCIDENT 2026-08-02 (operator's own session, project Chad):

    user: "You should find it in the project specif8cation not drawings"
    app:  "I could not confirm this reference in the indexed project sources
           for Chad. Please check whether the document is indexed or provide
           the exact filename."

That message was a CONVERSATIONAL CORRECTION, not a document lookup. The
stray '8' in the misspelling made the identifier extractor treat it as a
reference code; retrieval then missed on it, and the missing-reference
short-circuit in runtime.py answered with the "provide the exact filename"
template instead of letting the model respond.

Two rules had to be tightened, because the typo arrived through BOTH:
  * rule 4 (standalone alphanumeric codes) matched "specif8cation"
  * rule 3 (labeled references) split it into label "spec" + code
    "if8cation" — which carries a digit and so passed that rule's guard

The discriminator is the ALPHABETIC RUN. Real codes are built from short
abbreviations (M145, D999, PRC501, IP054); English words carry runs of 5+
letters, and a typo'd digit does not change that.
