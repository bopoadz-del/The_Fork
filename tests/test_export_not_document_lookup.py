"""An export request is not a document lookup (UI-PHYS H1 / diagnostic D6).

D6 finding: the H1 export turn dispatched **zero tools** and returned
"could not confirm this reference" in ~0.6s. The export action never ran —
`_should_short_circuit_rag_miss` fired first, and the router's refusal was
displayed as though it were the answer.

That gate already excludes self-coding and self-contained calculations on the
grounds that neither is a document lookup. An export request is the same kind
of thing: it asks for a FILE to be produced, not for a passage to be found
inside one.
