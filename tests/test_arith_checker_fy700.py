"""The fy modification chain is not a disagreement with its own addend.

Live on 23a04d0: ACI one-way slab answers from slab_thickness_min showed
correct working

    0.4 + 420/700 = 0.4 + 0.600 = 1.000

and the post-answer checker still appended "420/700 is 0.6, not 0.4"
(or "not 1"). The quotient was paired with the neighbouring addend, or
with the total of the whole sum. Each equality step has to be checked
against its own left side.

Wrong arithmetic in the same shape must still be flagged.
