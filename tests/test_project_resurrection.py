"""Deleted projects must STAY deleted across a restart.

Regression for the production "I deleted projects and they came back" bug:
deleting a project removed the Project row but left the legacy on-disk index
(``data/doc_index/<pid>.json`` / legacy db). On the next restart,
``doc_index.init_db()`` re-imported that legacy source and
``_ensure_project_row`` resurrected the project. Plus a real row carrying the
virtual master-corpus alias id duplicated the injected alias in listings.
