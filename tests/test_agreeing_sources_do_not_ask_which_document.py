"""Do not ask which source governs when the retrieved figures agree.

The first-line guard in ``app.agents.first_line_hard_rule``
(``apply_first_line_hard_rule`` → ``_select`` → ``_ask_which_figure``)
opens the answer with "Retrieved context states more than one …
figure: …. Which document's figure is meant?" whenever more than one
hit remains. That is right only for a genuine conflict: different
figures for the same item. It is wrong when the sources agree,
including two package copies of one clause, and it is wrong when one
clause states a required degree and an optional higher degree of that
same item.

Live on d708b5d, P1a (backfill compaction for foundations) opened every
run with that question while both hits said 98%. S2 (compaction under
road pavement) stated 100% and 95% and then asked which document
governs. The S2 verdict is recorded on
``test_s2_optional_higher_degree_of_the_same_subgrade_does_not_ask_which_document``.
S1 (minimum concrete cover) harvests unrelated millimetres from one
specification file — a paint band, a tile, a panel — and asks which
document's figure is meant.
