"""The cross-domain prompt inject must be relevant or absent.

`_cm_prompt_fragment_for_turn` puts this text into the system prompt of
`project-assistant` and `heavy-reasoning` — the two construction agents — as
assertive domain guidance. It is not a suggestion the model can weigh against
evidence; it reads as established fact about the project.

That makes a wrong linkage worse than no linkage, which is the whole point of
these tests. Before the relevance fix, `get_cross_domain_context` took
`get_rules_for_target(domain)[:3]` — the first three rules DECLARED for each
implicated domain. Declaration order is an artefact of the order somebody typed
DEFAULT_RULES, so a variation-order question was told, in its system prompt,
that "Critical safety incident triggers stop-work order in affected zone" was a
relevant construction management linkage.
