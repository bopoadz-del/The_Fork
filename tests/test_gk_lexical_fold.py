"""Tests for RAG_GK_LEXICAL_FOLD (TASK 2 — the EOT residual).

RAG_AUDIT_V3 showed the GK lexical bonus (+0.25/term, cap +1.2) lifts
curated notes ~+0.5 above any project chunk, so a user's own document
loses the H1 margin comparison to a bonused GK note even under cfg7.
The fold makes the H1 margin gate compare on the GK chunk's RAW fused
score (lexical bonus subtracted); survivors keep the bonus for ordering.

Contract under test:

  * flag unset (default): bit-identical to pre-fold behavior, even with
    the cfg7 knobs on — the bonused score faces the margin as before
  * flag on: a GK chunk whose raw score fails the margin but whose
    bonused score would pass is gated out; one whose raw score clears
    the margin survives WITH its bonus intact for ordering
  * CALC/KB intents bypass the fold entirely (same exemption as the
    H knobs)
  * empty project: GK-only fallback unaffected (margin gate skipped)
  * garbage flag values mean OFF (same contract as the H knobs)

Mocked-store pattern from test_gk_ranking_knobs.py: scores are exact.
Unlike that file, the query here deliberately overlaps GK chunk text so
_gk_lexical_bonus fires; active-project chunk text stays overlap-free.
