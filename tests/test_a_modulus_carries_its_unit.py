"""A bare number in kg/cm2 gets converted by guesswork.

Live SET4.1 T12, 7/10. The answer stated the ACI formula and its substitution
correctly -- "Ec = 4700 x sqrt(35) = 4700 x 5.9161" -- and then printed
**28,062 MPa**. That arithmetic gives 27,806. 28,062 is the tool's output,
280,624, divided by 10; the tool returns
``15000 x sqrt(f'c)`` in **kg/cm2** as a bare float, and 280,624 kg/cm2 is
27,520 MPa (x0.0980665), not 28,062.

So three different numbers were in play for one quantity, and nothing in the
payload said which unit it was in. The value now carries its unit and its own
MPa conversion, and the ACI 318-19 SI form is available on request -- that is
what an ACI question asks for.
