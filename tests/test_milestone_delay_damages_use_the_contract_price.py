"""The 8.8.1 delay-damages rate is per Milestone, on the Contract Price.

Live SET4.1 M3, "What are the delay damages in SAR per calendar day for
a section?":

  * 4/6 runs multiplied 0.015% by SAR 144,042,486.50 (SAR 21,606.37).
    That figure arrived in a higher-ranked excerpt — the executed cover
    and a pre-kickoff note — ahead of clause 1.1.1.
  * 2/6 runs multiplied by the Contract Price SAR 1,754,504,456.25
    (SAR 263,175.67) and then called it the whole-of-the-Works rate.

Contract Data 8.8.1 states the rate per calendar day per Milestone.
A question that says Section selects that same rate, and the sentence
states it as per Milestone. The base is the Contract Price, excluding VAT.
