"""One user's retrieval must not freeze the server for everyone else.

Live, 2026-09-20, build 72fcfd2: ONE chat turn stalled /livez -- an I/O-free
handler -- for 4.2 s (idle: 0.37 s). `rag_inject` (embedding + SQL + rerank) is
synchronous and was called directly inside the async chat path, so on the
single worker nothing else was served while it ran: no health check, no other
user's tokens. With six testers the stalls stacked and the proxy answered 502
with no deploy in progress.
