"""Payload coverage for the two actions un-parked on 2026-08-12.

`track_progress` and `generate_construction_report` were unroutable because
they were unrunnable: four helpers they called had never been written, and the
photo/BIM chain under `track_progress` also read a key (`elements`) that
`BIMExtractorBlock` has never returned, so it compared every photograph
against an empty model.

The helpers are implemented and the chain is fixed. These tests exist so that
wiring them does not simply move the problem from unreachable to untested --
each assertion is on a value that can only come from the chain actually
running end to end.

The dangerous failure mode here is not a crash. It is a CONFIDENT ZERO: with
no image block, or no resolvable model, the old code returned
`{"status": "success", "progress_percentage": 0}` -- a manufactured finding
that nothing has been built, indistinguishable on screen from a real one.
Several tests below exist only to hold that line.
