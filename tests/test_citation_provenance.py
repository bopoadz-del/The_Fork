"""Fence tests for the citation-provenance gate.

THE FIXTURE, and where it comes from. The F2 and G1 raw turns were captured
during the A-H gate battery on live ``13b2bf7`` (2026-08-31). The scored
evidence pack ``FLEET_OPS/artifacts/gate_battery_13b2bf7_2026-08-31.md``
records the load-bearing strings verbatim:

    F2 | PASS on the override, carries a Sev-1 | ... the answer cites
    ``BOQ context: Bill 03 - Demolition and Site Clearance (DD-2022-175)``
    -- the WRONG contract.

    G1 | FAIL -- asserted Schedule 10 "sets out any applicable Works
    Guarantees" and quoted CONTRACT TEMPLATE wording.

The surrounding prose of those two turns was lost with the workspace and the
platform's token has expired, so the answers around the citations here are
reconstructed; THE CITATION STRINGS THEMSELVES ARE THE RECORDED ONES. That
distinction is the point of the test, and it is stated rather than papered
over: the gate is asserted against the exact defect, not against a
paraphrase of it. The live re-proof is the full re-battery on the deployed
SHA, which is the next-but-one item in the owner's order.

Everything the gate's own logic rests on was verified literally on 13b2bf7,
not inferred:

* ``generate_wbs`` (schedule.py:2235) -- zero boq/bill/quantit/contract
  tokens in its body; it has no BOQ input to read.
* The string ``BOQ context`` does not occur anywhere in the repository, so
  nothing composed that line.
* ``construction_calc`` (construction/__init__.py:2164),
  ``resource_histogram`` (schedule.py:724), ``commissioning_checklist``
  (schedule.py:652), ``cash_flow_forecast`` (boq.py:1709) and ``wir_form``
  (documents.py:2112) likewise carry no corpus/retrieval reference.
