"""A BOQ line must be classified by what it IS, not by a trailing keyword.

`categorize` walked an ordered list and returned the FIRST pattern that matched
anywhere in the description. A description mentions its substrate as well as its
work -- "plaster render to blockwork walls" names blockwork, "waterproofing to
wet area floors" names floors -- so whichever category happened to sit earlier
in the list won, regardless of which word was the actual subject.

Measured on a real interior bill (2026-08-15):
  "15mm cement plaster render to blockwork walls"   -> Masonry/Blockwork (88/m2)
  "Cementitious waterproofing membrane to wet area floors" -> Finishes (38/m2)

Both priced as the wrong trade.

The head noun of a BOQ line comes FIRST -- that is how bills are written. So
the category whose pattern matches EARLIEST wins, with list order as the
tie-break. The one idiom that breaks the rule is "reinforced concrete", where
the leading word qualifies the following noun rather than naming the work, and
it is excluded explicitly.
