"""Stage 4 — user uploads land in the user_session layer, never polluting Main.

The operator's rule: an uploaded file goes to the user's own RAG layer, not the
authoritative main corpus. So a user upload is classified ``user_session`` and
carries the LOWEST layer precedence — it surfaces when it's the best semantic
match, but never outranks authoritative Main content (shared_domain / project_
record) at equal cosine.
