"""An over-long tool result must stay VALID JSON.

LIVE 2026-08-03, feature sweep against prod — two different actions, same
hard provider rejection:

    document_metadata        -> kimi HTTP 400
    parse_primavera_schedule -> kimi HTTP 400
    {"message": "Invalid request: tokenization failed",
     "type": "invalid_request_error"}

Cause: the `tool` message content was built as

    json.dumps(result, default=str)[:8000]

`json.dumps` emits ASCII with \\uXXXX escapes, so that raw slice can land
mid-escape or mid-string. The corpus makes it easy to hit — the client
filenames contain en dashes, which serialize to `\\u2013`:

    tail of cut: ' 2 \\u2013 specification (4 of 9).pdf", "'
    json.loads  -> Unterminated string starting at ... (char 7999)

The provider got malformed JSON and refused the whole request. Because a
failed turn also persisted nothing, the user just saw a question with no
answer (see tests/test_failed_turn_persistence.py).

# measured in cubic metres". The 945 m3 line is past the cut. It had been
# told only that the result "exceeded 8000 characters and was truncated" --
# not by how much -- so it inferred the extent from the content and inferred
# it wrong.
