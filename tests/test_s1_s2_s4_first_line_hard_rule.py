"""First line must carry the figure and the document that states it.

Live SET5 close-out on 209bc83 (Agent E, 6x), synthetic stand-ins only:

* S1 cover — SPLIT. The first line often had 75 mm and no document, or a
  document and no figure.
* S2 compaction — FAIL 0/6. The first line named a specification volume and
  "properly compacted" and left out the numeric figure that the retrieved
  context already held.
* S4 governing contract — SPLIT. The first line sometimes never named a
  contract that was visible in the context. Two contracts means ask which.

The Hard-rule sentences already told the model to open with the figure and
the document. These tests pin the behaviour the operator scores: the first
line of the answer that leaves ``_postprocess_answer``, not the prompt.
