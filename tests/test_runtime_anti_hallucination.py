"""Tests for the two runtime anti-hallucination guardrails:

1. ``_scrub_history`` strips assistant turns whose content contains a
   WBS/BOQ-shaped markdown table so the LLM can't pattern-match to a
   prior (often hallucinated) table when it should be calling the tool.
2. ``_user_intent_requires_tool`` returns True when the latest user
   message names a deliverable (schedule, WBS, BOQ, etc.). The runtime
   uses this to flip ``tool_choice`` from ``"auto"`` to ``"required"``
   for the project-assistant agent only.

Together they neutralise the failure mode caught via WebBridge: both
gpt-oss:120b and qwen3-coder:480b regenerated fake CPM tables (every
row Float=0 / Critical=Y, fabricated CSV paths) instead of calling
``generate_wbs`` when the conversation history contained prior
hallucinated tables.
