"""The secret scanner has to catch the shapes that actually got committed.

Two live credentials were sitting in this repository when the scanner was
written — a Fork API key in a recovery runbook and a Render key hardcoded in
a scheduled-task script. A third pair survived the FIRST version of the
scanner, because it was written as

    TOK=rnd_QqJ5...

with no quotes and a variable name (`TOK`) that no secret-name pattern
matches. That near-miss is why the provider-prefix rule exists and why
quotes are optional, and it is pinned here so neither can regress.

These tests exercise the rules directly rather than the repo walk, so they
stay true regardless of what the tree contains.

The `# pragma: allowlist secret` markers below are not a workaround — they
are the scanner's own escape hatch, used on the only lines in the repository
where secret-shaped strings are the point. The moment this file was committed
it became tracked, and the scanner correctly flagged its own fixtures. That
is the mechanism working. Marking each line keeps them visible and greppable
rather than carving out a path exclusion that would silently widen later.
