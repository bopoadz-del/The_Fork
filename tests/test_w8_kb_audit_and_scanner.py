"""W8 un-park — KB coverage audit + STANDARDS_SCANNER_BROADENED safe-on.

New test shapes (2026-07-25):
- The KB audit is a structural sweep over docs/knowledge/*.md: domain
  coverage buckets, non-empty titled notes, and — the sharp edge — NO
  project/client identifiers in the GENERAL layer (scrub policy). This
  audit found and scrubbed live leaks on its first run. That check now lives
  in scripts/scan_secrets.py, env-fed and fail-closed, because a test that
  names the identifiers inline is itself the leak.
- The scanner check is a PLANTED-DEVIATION probe: texts written to trip
  each broadened rule must be flagged, off-topic text must not be, and
  in every case the scan is advisory — it never mutates or blocks the
  deliverable.
