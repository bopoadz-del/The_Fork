"""A measured quantity is not a document reference.

Live-fire find 2026-08-15 (F21). A grounded costing request carrying the
measured take-off quantities was refused three times in ~1 second each:

    "... floor screed, 1947.87 square metres; ceramic skirting, 2342.20
     metres ..." -> "I could not confirm this reference in the indexed
     project sources. Please check whether the document is indexed."

Mechanism, probed locally: ``extract_query_identifiers`` returned
``['1947.87', '2342.20']`` -- the standalone-alphanumeric-code pattern
matches letterless decimals, no chunk contains those exact strings, and the
exact-reference miss gate short-circuits the whole turn. Any costing or
take-off question that states its quantities was structurally un-askable on
a grounded project.

Pure numbers with a decimal separator are now excluded from identifier
extraction. Hyphenated digit codes (drawing/sheet refs) still match, and
codes that carry letters (D999.46) still match.
