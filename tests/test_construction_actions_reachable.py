"""The construction container's action surface must close in both directions.

Audit 2026-08-12.

The first version of this file only asked "can route() dispatch every public
action?". That question was too weak, and it let a worse bug through: three
actions were unreachable, and wiring them into the router turned an honest
`{"status": "error", "error": "Unknown action: ..."}` into an unhandled
AttributeError — a 500 instead of a refusal.

The reason they were unreachable was not an oversight. Two of them cannot run:

    generate_construction_report  -> self._generate_doc_recommendations
    track_progress                -> self._assess_delay_risk
      (and, one level down, _compare_photo_to_bim -> self._element_similarity,
       self._find_deviations)

None of those four helpers has ever been defined in this repository.
`git log -S "def _assess_delay_risk" --all` and its three siblings return
nothing. `generate_construction_report` additionally reads five keys off
`process_document` that its current contract does not return. So the methods
were dead because they were broken, and "unreachable" was the symptom.

That is the general lesson this file now encodes: reachability alone is not
health. An action can be routable and still be incapable of executing. So the
fence checks three things, not one:

  1. FORWARD  — every action name a caller surface can emit is dispatchable.
  2. REVERSE  — every dispatchable action is named by some caller surface,
                or is on a short documented list of externally-called ones.
  3. RUNNABLE — no method in the package calls a `self.` helper that does not
                exist. This is the assertion that would have caught the four
                missing helpers on the day they were written.

Note the two namespaces. `handlers` aliases deliberately
(`"schedule_risk": self.analyze_schedule_risk`), so the KEYS are what callers
name and the `self.<method>` targets are what the class defines. Checks that
mix them report false positives; that mistake was made once during this audit.
