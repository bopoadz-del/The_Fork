"""forensic_delay_analysis must compute, not just return a shape.

Audit bar 3, 2026-08-12. Replacing the whole body with

    return {"status": "success", "delay_events": [], "critical_delays": [],
            "total_delay_days": 0}

left 16 tests green. Every reference to the action in tests/ was a string in an
alias list, an entry in the eval-battery harness, or a routing docstring; the
one test with "delay_analysis" in its name calls parse_primavera_schedule and
asserts `isinstance(..., list)` — its own name says "shape".

That matters more here than in most places. This is the EOT / prolongation
path: its output feeds a claim value and an expert report. A version of it that
silently returned zeros would have produced a confidently empty claim.

The anchor assertion is metamorphic rather than a golden number: analysing a
programme against ITSELF must yield zero net delay. That holds no matter which
baseline is used, so it does not rot when the fixture changes, and it cannot be
satisfied by a stub that returns an arbitrary constant — the stub also has to
classify the events it was handed and populate the report sections.
