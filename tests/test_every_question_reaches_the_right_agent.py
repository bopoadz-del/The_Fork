"""Routing: does the question reach something that can answer it?

Live, 2026-09-20: "Our BOQ has 1,250 m2 of blockwork at SAR 62/m2 but site
measured 1,318 m2. What is the cost variance ...?" was answered in 4 s with
"I could not confirm this reference in the indexed project sources" -- three
asks out of three, pinned to quantity-surveyor too. The identifier extractor
read the unit RATE "62/m2" as a reference code (it looks like page "d/3/3"),
retrieval found no document called 62/m2, and the missing-reference shortcut
answered before anything could calculate. Every number the question needs is
in the question.
