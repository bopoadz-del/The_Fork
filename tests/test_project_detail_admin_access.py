"""List/detail authz consistency (2026-07-24 live finding).

Admins see EVERY project in GET /v1/projects, but the detail page 404'd any
project they didn't own (the operator hit this clicking an eval-fixture
project: "doesn't exist or you don't have access"). Read-only detail access
must match list visibility: admins may open any project; non-admins keep the
owner-or-approved-platform rule; mutation stays owner-only.
