"""A follow-up that says "the letter" cannot be retrieved on by itself.

Live on 24d1c0c, master_corpus, one conversation, three runs:

    D1  Who signed the letter about the UBCC concrete batching plant at
        Wadi Safar, and in what capacity?                          3/3
    D2  Per that letter, since when had the land been delivered
        to AICC?                                                   3/3
    D3  What reason does the letter give for no longer needing a
        pre-cast factory?                                          1/3

D3's two failures retrieved precast-concrete SPECIFICATIONS -- tolerances,
rejection criteria, sampling -- and honestly reported no letter. The words
that carry signal in D3 are "pre-cast factory"; the word that says which
document is "the letter", and that points at turn one.

Follow-up expansion already existed, but only for a THIN message (under four
content terms). D3 has seven. Length was standing in for the real property:
the message refers to something it does not identify. D2 passed only because
its own words ("land delivered to AICC") happen to sit in the letter.
