"""The container's block delegations must reach the block they name.

Audit bars 2 and 3, 2026-08-12, for the formulas / orchestration cluster --
`sympy_reason`, `orchestrate`, `formula_execute`, `bim_extract`, `learn`,
`recommend`, `drawing_qto` and their siblings.

These are five-line pass-throughs: resolve a block by name, return an honest
error if it is absent, otherwise `await block.process(input_data, params)`.
There is no arithmetic to get wrong, so a control-delete of the body says
little. The two things that CAN be wrong are both silent:

  1. The block name is a typo or has drifted. `_resolve_block("formulaexec")`
     returns None and the action answers "block unavailable" -- which reads as
     a deployment/profile problem, not as a bug, and would survive a release.
  2. The delegation stops delegating. Nothing downstream notices if the action
     returns its own shaped dict instead of the block's answer.

Coverage before this file: `formula_execute` and `orchestrate` were referenced
by NO test in the repository except the router fence. `sympy_reason` and
`bim_extract` had one file each.
