"""PR #78 — smart_orchestrator routing gate in app/agents/runtime.py.

Pre-PR-#78, real user chat traffic bypassed smart_orchestrator entirely
(the React UI calls /v1/agents/project-assistant/chat/stream which lands
directly on Agent.chat_stream). PR #78 adds ``select_agent_for_message``
as a gate the agents-router calls before dispatch so generative-intent
queries redirect to the heavy-reasoning agent.

These tests exercise the gate directly (without the FastAPI router) so
the contract is locked even when the router's auth / project-ownership
plumbing changes around it.
