"""No path may ship the platform's own context, including one I cannot name.

#457 put the context-leak check in the streamed-synthesis branch and in
_sanitize_final_text, and E1 came back clean on the deploy. It recurred once
on 87c7996 -- same shape, same wbs_id / retrieval brief / customer Drive
paths -- while the next run of the same question was clean, and the run after
that was clean too.

Intermittent means a path neither guard covers. Sampling seven-minute live
turns to find which one is a poor trade, so this sits where every event the
client sees passes through: chat_stream wraps _chat_stream_impl, and one
check at that seam cannot be bypassed by any branch inside it.
