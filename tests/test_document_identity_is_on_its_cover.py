"""Who prepared a document, its number and its revision are on its cover.

Live on 24d1c0c, master_corpus, 0/3:

    "What is the document number and revision of the priced Bill of
     Quantities, and who prepared it?"

The cover is indexed, in a file whose NAME is the title the question uses:

    IP-...-BOQ-CA-000007-B_Bill of Quantities (Priced).pdf  [chunk 3]
    Document no: ... 000007  Revision no: B  Prepared by: <firm>  Date: ...

Searched by its document number, that chunk ranks first at 2.07. Asked the
way a person asks, the top five are contract templates describing HOW a bill
of quantities should be identified. Nothing in the question resembles a cover
sheet: a control block is labels and codes, and "document number", "revision"
and "prepared" are in every template in the corpus.

The filename rescue that should have caught it keeps the five most
"distinctive" words of the question -- capitalised first -- and "priced", the
one word that tells this bill from the unpriced one, came sixth.

These tests pin the shape: an ask about a document's IDENTITY is answered by
the control block of the document the question names.
