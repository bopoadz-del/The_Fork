"""Standards advisory — ADVISORY, never blocking.

Wires the previously-dormant construction_knowledge.enforce_critical_rules into
the agent answer path: a deviation from a critical standard (e.g. 'APPROVED' on
a design document, PRC-501) appends a flagged note but NEVER rejects, edits, or
halts the answer. Operators bend rules deliberately; the platform flags, it does
not stop.
