"""The turn's evidence must be the last thing the budget takes.

Measured on the real thing: a five-chunk Contract Data brief is 8072
characters -- 1704 of instructions and 6368 of evidence. The compactor cut
any system message over 2500 characters to ``content[:2500]``, which kept
every word of the instructions and 796 characters of evidence: ONE excerpt
of five, sliced mid-sentence, with nothing to say four were gone.

That is the worst possible trade. The header tells the model it is holding
authoritative context and must answer from it; the compactor then removes
the context and leaves the instruction. It is also why two live answers on
554e0b9 reported a fact "missing" that retrieval had actually returned:

    D1  "the specific Contract Data entry ... that names the individual
         Engineer's Representative is missing from what was returned"
    E1  "The retrieved excerpts do not contain the Contract Price expressed
         in SAR"

Both read as retrieval misses. Neither was.
