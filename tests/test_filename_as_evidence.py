"""A document's FILENAME can be the only place a fact exists.

Live case (Infra Pack UI eval, 2026-08-23, Q5). Asked when the Street Lighting
NOC expires, retrieval returned the correct document — and the answer was still
wrong, because "17 July 2025" appears nowhere in the extracted text. It exists
only in the filename::

    AM Rev Design NOC DG2 Infra Package 1 - Street Lighting (exp. 17Jul25).pdf

The chunk itself is OCR-degraded: "NOC Reference 0095-DG2-PR Issue Date
13\02\2025 ... Time Duration 6 months". So the model did date arithmetic on
noise to reach a date the document never states in extractable form.

No amount of ranking work fixes that — the model simply never saw the name.
Construction documents routinely carry expiry dates, revision letters,
discipline codes and status in the filename alone, so the name travels with
each excerpt now.

Deliberately NOT embedded: putting the filename into the indexed text would
mean re-embedding all 172,809 chunks, and would let filename tokens influence
similarity. This is a context change only.
