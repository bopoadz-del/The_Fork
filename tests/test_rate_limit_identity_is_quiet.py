"""Rate-limit identification must be silent on the NORMAL path.

Live-fire campaign, run 1 (2026-08-14): production logs carried one full
traceback per request --

    WARNING app.main swallowed Exception in _rate_limit_identity() - continuing
    jwt.exceptions.DecodeError: Not enough segments

An API key is not a JWT, so ``decode_token`` raised for every key-authed
request. The result was correct (fall through to hashing the key) but it was
reached by exception, and the handler logged ``exc_info=True`` every time.
Real warnings were buried under per-request noise.

These tests fence the OBSERVABILITY property, not the return value: the normal
paths must emit no warning, while a genuinely unexpected failure must still be
loud. A test that only checked the returned identity would have stayed green
through the entire incident.

    Two earlier attempts measured the logging framework instead of the code and

       earlier test that touched propagation or handlers changed the answer.
    2. A handler attached to ``app.main``'s logger -- still subject to logger
       level, ``logging.disable()``, and whatever global state 3000-odd other
       tests leave behind.

    The property under test is "does this function report the failure?", and
    that is a question about the call, not about delivery. Substituting the
    module-level ``logger`` name that ``_rate_limit_identity`` closes over
    answers exactly that question and cannot be perturbed by ambient config.
