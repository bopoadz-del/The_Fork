"""Importing the app must not drag in the heavy ML stack.

2026-08-11: the Render deploy failed because startup never opened a port inside
the platform's scan window, so the container was restarted on top of itself and
the two overlapping processes were killed (status 137). Measured cause:
`import app.main` alone took 10.7s and 282 MB, because app/blocks/__init__.py
imports every block eagerly and three of them imported heavy libraries at module
scope:

  * app/blocks/vector_search.py + zvec.py -> sklearn  (~3.2s, pulls scipy+pandas)
  * app/blocks/_knowledge.py              -> sympy    (~1.0s)
  * app/blocks/safety_world_detector.py   -> ultralytics (~265 MB, pulls torch+cv2)

None of them is used at import time, and the safety detector is disabled
entirely on that host (SAFETY_WORLD_WEIGHTS unset), so the cost bought nothing.
Deferring them cut import to 5.0s and 177 MB.

This is a REGRESSION FENCE, not a style rule. The libraries are still
dependencies and still used — the requirement is only that they load on first
use rather than at boot. A new `import torch` at the top of any block would
silently undo the fix, and the symptom would be a failed deploy, not a failed
test. So the test asserts on a subprocess's real sys.modules after importing
the app, which is the same thing the container does.
