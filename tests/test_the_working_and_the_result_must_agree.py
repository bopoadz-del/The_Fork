"""An answer's own arithmetic must agree with its own result.

Two live defects of the same shape, found a day apart and fixed one at a time:

    T20  "L/20 = 4800/20 = 200 mm"          -- 4800/20 is 240
    T12  "Ec = 4700 x 5.9161 = 28,062 MPa"  -- that product is 27,806

Both answers stated the right rule, the right inputs and a wrong number. Every
visible part was correct, so a reader who checks the working is *reassured* by
it — which makes this the most dangerous defect shape the platform produces.
Each needed its own fix (a unit conversion in the binder, a unit on a modulus
payload); this catches the class.

The mismatch is ANNOTATED, never silently corrected: rewriting the figure
would hide that the answer and its own working disagree, and that fact is
what the reader needs.
