"""The SSE ``end`` event must name the tools the turn actually ran.

Reported symptom: a self-coding answer produced the right number
(31.62 USD/ft2) and said "Tool: code" in its prose, while the SSE reported
``tools=[]``. The prose and the stream disagreed because only the prose carried
the information -- every ``end`` event emitted iterations/model/sources/exports
and no tools field at all, so the UI read an ABSENT key as an empty list.

The runtime always knew: the TIMING log line prints
``tools=['formula_executor_v2']`` for the same turn. These tests pin the field
onto the machine-readable contract so the badge cannot silently disagree with
the answer again.
