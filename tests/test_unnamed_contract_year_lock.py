"""An unnamed contract question is won by evidence, not by arrival order.

Live wave-1 on the Master Corpus, SHA ``567147a``, measured five Contract
Data questions against one corpus in one session and got both outcomes:

* **A2** (Accepted Contract Amount incl. VAT) — PASS
* **A6** (Defects Notification Period) — PASS
* **A3** (Time for Completion, whole of the Works) — FAIL, ``the retrieved
  excerpts do not contain`` it
* **A5** (Delay Damages, whole of the Works) — FAIL, cited **Sub-Clause
  8.8** and then reported the rate and the cap as absent from its excerpts
* **A9** (who the Engineer is) — FAIL_WRONG_CONTRACT, answered out of a
  **different contract year's** Conditions of Contract with nothing but the
  generic defined-term entry

A2 and A6 prove the Contract Data is indexed and retrievable, so the three
failures are not a corpus gap. What separates them is which chunk happened
to sort first: the unnamed fence locks the pool to the first candidate
carrying a ``PREFIX-YEAR-SEQ`` id and DROPS every other id, so a wrong-year
chunk at rank 1 does not merely outrank the row holding the answer — it
deletes it, at every rank. A2/A6 won that race; A3/A5/A9 lost it.

Two things decide the race wrongly, and both are pinned below.

1. A General Conditions clause that says *"at the rate stated in the
   Contract Data"* is a **pointer** to the answer. It carries the heading
   phrase and, being a clause about delay damages, repeats every label word
   the question uses — so it collected the Contract Data heading tier plus
   the full label bonus and beat the row that actually states the rate.
   That is A5's symptom exactly: cite 8.8, then report the rate as missing.
2. *"Who is the Engineer"* was never recognised as asking for a filled
   particular at all, because a particular was assumed to be a figure. No
   part of the particulars machinery ran on A9, so a glossary definition
   won on raw cosine — and locked its own contract year.

WAVE 2 added three more of the same family, and the second half of this
file covers them:

* **F1** FAIL_WRONG_CONTRACT — a WBS over "the demolition and site
  clearance scope in this project's BOQ" cited another contract year's
  Conditions of Contract three times out of three. Its prose describes that
  scope in words; the bill carries it as measured rows. Not a Contract Data
  particular, so the election declined and arrival order decided.
* **G1** FAIL_WRONG_CONTRACT (Sev-1) — "what does Schedule 10 of the
  contract contain" was answered out of a **different project's** show
  package, which has a Schedule 10 of its own and discusses it at length.
  The contract's own register says ``Schedule 10: Not Used``, which IS the
  answer and IS a filled particulars row — but the ask was not recognised
  as wanting one, so nothing lifted it and the fence dropped the contract.
* **E1** FAIL — "calculate the delay damages per calendar day in SAR"
  retrieved the 0.1%-per-day row and then reported the SAR figure as
  absent. A percentage is not an amount, and the row holding the amount
  shares no wording with the question.

SANITIZED FIXTURE. The two contract/document ids are the live ones and are
already in git (``tests/test_cross_contract_fence.py``, ``AGENTS.md``);
every figure, party and value here is fixture-only and deliberately differs
from the live pack, which must never land in the repository. What is under
test is the mechanism — which contract's Contract Data rows reach the
top-k — not the live numbers.
