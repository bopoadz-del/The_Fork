"""Retrieval must recognise a word it already knows in another form.

The term rescue matches each query term as a SUBSTRING of the chunk text, so
the query's word and the document's word have to share a prefix. Live 23 Sep
2026 on 589e637, the same content was rank 1 for a keyword query and absent
from the top 40 for the user's own question:

    "To what degree must structural backfill be compacted?"
      -> never retrieved the chunk reading "Compaction of the backfill to
         minimum 98% of maximum dry density of the modified proctor test"

compacted / compaction diverge after "compact", so no pair co-occurred and the
rescue stayed silent. Stemming the query term (never the chunk) closes it.
Synthetic corpus and synthetic figures throughout.
