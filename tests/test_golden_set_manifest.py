"""Contract tests for tests/golden_set.yaml and its gate runner.

The golden set is the TASK 4e pilot gate's test plan; these tests defend the
invariants the gate relies on so a hand-edit cannot silently weaken it:
parseable yaml, 25-30 queries, every entry with a prompt and answer_expect,
the mandatory EOT project-vs-GK collision case with both expect and reject,
compilable regexes, and full coverage of the 12 pilot-critical features.
load_golden_set() itself raises on the structural defects (missing prompt,
bad regex, duplicate id), so a successful parse here already proves those.
