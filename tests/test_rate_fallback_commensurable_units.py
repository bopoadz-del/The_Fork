"""A fallback rate must have the same dimensions as the line it prices.

Live-fire campaign phase 3, F10. The rate-card had no Pipework/Drainage or
Mechanical/HVAC rows for Buildings/Towers AED, so MEP lines fell to wild
fallbacks. Real observed lump-sum MEP rates from a 2012 Dubai fit-out BOQ
now fill the lump-sum cells -- but that exposed the sharper defect this
file fences: the category-median fallback pooled rates ACROSS UNITS, so a
per-metre pipe run would have been priced from an AED 26,525 lump-sum
median. A number with the wrong dimensions is worse than NO RATE.

The fallback tiers now pool only unit-commensurable rates (linear / area /
volume / mass / count / lump). A tier with nothing commensurable is
skipped; a line whose unit has no known class keeps the legacy any-unit
pools because commensurability cannot be judged.
