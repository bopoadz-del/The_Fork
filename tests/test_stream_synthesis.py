"""`_stream_synthesis` -- the path that decides whether the user watches an
answer appear or waits in silence.

Audit bar 3, 2026-08-12, agents subsystem. Replacing the whole body with a bare
`return` left all 150 agent tests green. One test file referenced it, and every
reference was a mock.

The reason a gutted body is invisible is that this function is DESIGNED to be
fallible: it raises `_SynthStreamError` on any pre-first-token failure and the
caller silently falls back to the non-streaming `_call_llm`. So a version that
never streams anything produces a working platform that is merely slower --
which no test notices, and which a user experiences as "it hangs for 40 seconds
then dumps the whole answer at once".

The invariant that carries real risk is the mid-stream one. The caller must
never restart a stream it has already begun, and it distinguishes the two cases
solely by whether tokens were emitted. If a mid-stream drop stopped raising, or
started raising before yielding what it had, the user would see a duplicated or
truncated answer. That is pinned explicitly below.

Mocked at `httpx.AsyncClient.stream`, which is a different shape from
`_call_llm`'s `post` -- a synchronous call returning an async context manager
whose object exposes `status_code`, `aread()` and `aiter_lines()`.
