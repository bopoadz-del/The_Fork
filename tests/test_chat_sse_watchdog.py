"""A TURN ENDS WITH AN ANSWER OR A REASON (owner's numbered item 5).

F-SILENT-1, from ``FLEET_OPS/artifacts/gate_battery_13b2bf7_2026-08-31.md``:

    a turn that ends with neither an answer nor an error (B6, first pass).
    119 seconds, three events (``start``, ``route``, ``start``), then
    nothing: no tokens, no ``end`` content, no error, HTTP 200.

B6's own event sequence is the fixture below, because the fence has to be
against the observed shape and not against a convenient one. The agent's
existing guard did not catch it: that guard begins inside
``Agent.chat_stream``, and B6's last event was the agent's own ``start``,
with the turn dying in the router's frame -- past ``route``.

Each test names the mutation it kills.
