"""look_ahead with an embedded synthetic programme must not ask which XER.

Live exit on 78bd9ca (FIXTURE-d with several uploaded .xer copies): look_ahead
routed correctly but _resolve_predefined_file_params returned the multi-file
ask-which message, so the tool never ran on the synthetic activity list in
the operator message. When the ask already carries durations / activity
codes, skip schedule_file auto-resolution (leave unset / do not ask-which).
