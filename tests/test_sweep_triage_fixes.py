"""Two real bugs surfaced by the 2026-07-25 fresh sweep triage.

Both had the answer's numbers sitting in the prompt, same family as the
payment_certificate / cash_flow figures-from-message fixes:

1. carbon_footprint_calculator computed ZERO for "12,000 m3 of C40
   concrete and 900t of rebar" — predefined dispatch sent empty params,
   so the quantities in the message were never parsed.
2. sympy_reason variance question ("planned SAR 4.2M vs actual SAR 5.1M")
   got the cost-grounding refusal — the gate didn't count the USER's own
   supplied figures as grounded, so it refused to echo them back.
