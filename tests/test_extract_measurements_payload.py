"""extract_measurements must read the drawing, not just answer in the shape.

Audit bar 3, 2026-08-12. This is the one of three unreachable actions that
turned out to be real and was kept wired (the other two cannot run at all --
see tests/test_construction_actions_reachable.py). Wiring it was only half the
job: control-delete showed it had no coverage that could detect it breaking.

Replacing the whole body with

    return {"status": "success", "measurements": [], "specifications": [],
            "count": 0, "confidence": 0}

left tests/test_all_blocks.py and tests/test_blocks_simple.py green -- 24
passed. Both reference the action, but both call it with `{}` and no file, so
they only ever exercise the honest-error branch. The extraction itself was
untested, which is the usual reason an action is unreachable in the first
place: nothing ever ran it.

Measured on the real drawing fixture: 34 measurements, 16 distinct raw
strings, 3 specifications.
