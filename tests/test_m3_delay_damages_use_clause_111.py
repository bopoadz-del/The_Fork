"""M3: per-Milestone delay damages use clause 1.1.1, and name that source.

Live on 0b1d13a, every run:

    Delay damages per Milestone are SAR 5,864.76 per calendar day
    (0.015% of the Contract Price SAR 39,098,392.98).

SAR 39,098,392.98 is the partial Accepted Contract Amount on the rate
document's leading chunk. It is not clause 1.1.1. The rate document's
own Contract Price is SAR 1,754,504,456.25 (0.015% → SAR 263,175.67).
The line also names no source: the clause window contains the
neighbouring whole-of-Works wording, so the quote is dropped.

A whole-of-Works ask on the same shape takes the first excluding-VAT
clause it sees (a purchase-order 1.1.1 of SAR 55,000,000.00) instead of
the rate document's clause 1.1.1. A rewording whose partial row is not
marked excluding VAT refuses, even though clause 1.1.1 was retrieved
under another doc id.

Synthetic amounts only. The partial and the filled clause are the
figures already used by the E1 fixtures.
