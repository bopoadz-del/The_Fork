"""SSE end-event `exports` descriptors — data-backed download offers.

The chat bubble already exposes an inline "Download" affordance under each
assistant answer (no separate UI buttons). This contract extends it: when the
answer cites a document the platform can turn into a real artifact, the end
event carries an `exports` descriptor so the bubble can offer that artifact
directly.

Pilot scope (intentional): only the **cost BOQ** is offerable from chat — its
export endpoint self-derives from a `document_id`. The gate is cheap metadata
only (extension + name); boq_processor is NEVER run here in the hot path (a
large scanned BOQ OOMs the box — memory `the-fork-boq-always-xlsx`), so the
offer is restricted to digital xlsx/csv BOQs that actually parse. Schedule/EVM
are deferred — chat turns don't yet produce their inline activities/periods.
