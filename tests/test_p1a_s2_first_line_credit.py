"""First line credits the clause and the document that carry the figure.

Live measurement on 0b1d13a (42 asks x 6 runs), gate G8: the right
number with the wrong or missing source is a FAIL.

* P1a stated 98% and never put §8.4 on the first line (wrong label),
  6/6 on P1a, P1a-f1 and P1a-f3.
* S2 credited 95% to the wrong source. RSM 15492 was on the first line
  0/24 times. The owner bar is Specification Section 9.1 (RSM 15492),
  and the line never says "not the specification".

The class: when the chunk that holds the committed figure also carries
a clause or section id and a document id, the first line credits both.
It does not credit a different document, and it does not ask anything
back once the figure is stated.

Gate G7: the original phrasing, three rewordings, and one sibling
(a different clause and figure with the same shape). Synthetic chunks
only. Names start with FIXTURE-d-20260928-. Retrieval ranking is not
under test; the chunks are already on the turn.
