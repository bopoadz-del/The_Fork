"""`_build_exports_from_audit` decides which download buttons the user is shown.

Audit bar 3, 2026-08-12, agents subsystem. Replacing the whole body with
`return []` left all 150 agent tests green. One test file referenced the name;
nothing asserted an offer was ever produced.

An empty list is this function's own honest answer for a turn that produced
nothing exportable, which makes `return []` an unusually good disguise: the
gutted version is indistinguishable from correct behaviour on most turns, and
the failure it causes -- the export buttons quietly stop appearing -- looks to
the user like a product that never had the feature.

The opposite failure is worse and is the reason the function is metadata-only:
its own note says an offer that 422s on click is worse than no offer. So the
tests below pin BOTH directions -- the offer appears when the data backs it,
and does not appear when it does not.

Every positive test asserts a non-empty result with the exact endpoint, never
just "no exception". `[]` is the flattering default here; asserting a
truthy-shaped absence is how this function would be tested vacuously.
