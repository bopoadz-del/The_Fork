"""Provider-outage injection — the platform must degrade HONESTLY.

New test shape (2026-07-25): the worst pilot failures were provider outages
(the 2026-07-24 kimi-HTTP-400 storm) where fallbacks quietly produced
boilerplate that read as invented answers. This probe kills the LLM at the
client seam and asserts the chat surface reports an honest error — no
fabricated construction numbers, no silent success.
