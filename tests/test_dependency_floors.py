"""Security floors for pinned dependencies.

Exists because the dependency gate (pip-audit) ran report-only for months —
`continue-on-error: true` plus `|| true` meant its green check could never
fail, and HIGH-severity pins rode straight through PR review (found in the
2026-08-04 PRR: cryptography CVE-2026-69247, aiohttp CVE-2026-69244).

pip-audit is now enforcing, but its database can lag a freshly published
advisory. These floors pin the *adjudicated* minimums so a merge that
resolves a requirements conflict by reverting to an older pin — exactly how
the Redis merge reintroduced two other defects — fails loudly with the CVE
it would be reintroducing.

When a new advisory raises a floor: bump the pin, then record the new floor
here with its advisory ID.

# it needs a test rather than a comment.
