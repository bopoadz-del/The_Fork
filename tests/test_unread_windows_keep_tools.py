"""Half a document is not a deliverable.

Live on 1d3c98b -- the build that introduced char_offset. Asked for the m3
demolition quantity:

    "Limitation: The PDF is 16 pages long and the extraction result was
     truncated; I can only see the first portion (roughly through page 5).
     Because the later pages are not visible to me, I cannot confirm whether
     an m3 item appears deeper in the bill ... If you know the page number
     or the CESMM code you are looking for, I can try to narrow the search"

It never called boq_processor again. It could not: boq_processor is a
deliverable tool, so force_synthesis fired on the first result and the next
call went out with_tools=False.

So the envelope told the model to read the next window and the platform took
its tools away. That is the same failure the sympy_reasoning carve-out in
_should_force_synthesis already exists for -- an instruction the system then
prevents -- with a different tool.
