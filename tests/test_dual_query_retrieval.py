"""Natural questions must find the same chunks their terse phrasings find.

Live-fire campaign phase 3, F18. Measured against a real 203-page contract
and a 129-page tender indexed on the live service: the needle chunk ranks
FIRST (0.933) for a query overlapping the answer's wording, and falls out
of the top-12 when the same fact is asked as a natural question. The
interrogative scaffolding drags the query vector away from the document's
declarative prose.

Two probe campaigns pinned the mechanism:

  * stopword distillation FAILS -- "Conditions Contract days Time
    Completion whole Works" breaks the noun phrases and ranks nowhere;
  * wrapper stripping that keeps phrases contiguous WORKS -- "days is the
    Time for Completion for the whole of the Works" took the 852-day
    needle from outside the top-12 to rank 1 (0.933), and the tender
    variant took its needle to rank 4 (0.588).

The fix is dual-query retrieval: search with BOTH phrasings, merge by max
score per chunk. This fence pins the transform to the exact strings the
live probes validated, and the merge machinery around it.
