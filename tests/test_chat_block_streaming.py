"""The chat block's streaming generator must actually stream.

Caught by the dead-function gate on its first CI run: `_stream_generator` was
covered on a developer machine but had ZERO coverage in CI, so the streaming
fast-path was effectively untested on the only environment that ships. A
generator is lazy -- `_call_cloud` returns it without executing a single line,
so a test that merely calls `_call_cloud` and asserts `status == "success"`
covers none of the streaming body and still looks green.

These consume the generator, which is the only way its body runs at all.

Mocked at the httpx TRANSPORT boundary so every line of our own parsing runs:
the SSE framing, the `[DONE]` sentinel, the non-200 error path, and the
Ollama empty-Bearer guard the comments call out by name.
