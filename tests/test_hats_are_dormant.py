"""The discipline-hat system may not be switched on while its actions are fiction.

Audit 2026-08-12, agents subsystem. Registered in KNOWN_INCOMPLETE.md under
"Stated limitations"; this file is the part that bites.

There are two agent systems here and only one runs. `runtime.load_agents()`
returns the 14 live agents. Separately, `app/agents/manifests/fork.*.json`
declares a base plus five discipline hats, each with an `allowed_actions` list,
gated behind `FORK_HATS_ENABLED`. That flag is unset everywhere, `runtime.py`
contains zero references to `allowed_actions`, and 32 of the 35 plain action
names the manifests declare resolve to no block, no container route key and no
synthetic tool.

So the flag is not an on-switch for five disciplines. Flipping it grants agents
permission to call 32 actions that do not exist -- the same failure the
container audit found, where `_suggest_next_action` recommended an action
`route()` answered "Unknown action" to, except 32 times over and reachable from
a single environment variable in a dashboard.

WHAT THIS FILE ASSERTS, AND WHY IT IS SHAPED THIS WAY

Not "32 actions are undispatchable" -- that pins the defect in place and goes
red the moment someone starts fixing it, which trains people to edit the test.

The invariant is CONDITIONAL: while the flag is off, an undispatchable action
is a known gap and this file merely keeps the register honest about its size.
The moment the flag is on, every declared action must be dispatchable. That
permits incremental progress in the good direction and blocks the one move that
turns a dormant subsystem into a live defect.
