"""drawing_qto asks must force drawing_qto, not construction_calc.

Live exit 78bd9ca: a quantity-takeoff / drawing_qto ask was stolen by
construction_calc because ``_DELIVERABLE_PHRASES`` forced tool_choice=
required while ``_forced_specific_tool`` had no named drawing_qto row.
Same class as cash_flow_forecast → generate_wbs and procurement/RFI →
construction_calc.

Self-contained L×W×D volume asks (leftover L6) must stay on
construction_calc — they do not match the drawing_qto phrases.
