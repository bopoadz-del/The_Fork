"""Bridge ``generate_wbs`` output into ``generate_cost_loaded_schedule`` input.

``ConstructionContainer.generate_wbs`` emits activities shaped for CPM display
— ``duration_days`` (int), ``resources`` (a trade-name list), ``wbs_phase`` —
with no ``manpower`` and no ``cost``. ``generate_cost_loaded_schedule`` needs
``duration``, ``manpower``, ``wbs`` and, optionally, ``cost``. This module maps
one to the other.

Honesty contract (why cost is not fabricated here):
  A schedule generated from a brief has NO estimate behind it. Man-days
  (crew x duration) can be derived honestly and drive the progress S-curve /
  manpower histogram. Cost cannot — ``cost = man-days x day_rate`` is just the
  man-days curve rescaled by a rate we invented, so we leave ``cost`` UNSET
  unless the caller supplies a real ``day_rate`` (then it is an *indicative
  labor* figure the workbook labels as such) or the activity already carries a
  real cost. We never zero-fill cost as if it were measured.

The per-field derivation only fills what is ABSENT, so passing already
cost-loaded activities through is a no-op — safe to apply at any call site.
