"""Derive a construction schedule from a priced BOQ — quantities become man-hours.

Why this exists
---------------
``/export/schedule-from-document`` accepted a BOQ and produced a schedule whose
activities came from a canned per-project-type template: measured 2026-08-17,
a BOQ listing structural steel truss, composite cladding, chilled-water piping
and epoxy flooring yielded 46 activities of which ZERO referenced that scope.
The document route mines equipment lead times and target milestones; a BOQ
carries neither, so it contributed nothing.

A BOQ is the one document that states the actual scope WITH quantities, which
is exactly what a duration needs.

Man-hours are the unit
----------------------
Planning is done in MAN-HOURS, not "crew-days" (operator correction,
2026-08-17: "everything is in manhour"). A norm of 0.8 mh/m2 is a property of
the work; a crew-day figure silently bundles crew size and shift length into
one number, so it cannot be compared between projects, cannot be re-planned
when the crew changes, and cannot produce an honest manpower histogram. So:

    total_manhours  = quantity x manhours_per_unit
    duration_days   = ceil(total_manhours / (crew_size x hours_per_day))

The histogram and S-curve then fall out of the same man-hours rather than
being derived separately — the programme and the resource curve agree by
construction, which is the whole point of a cost/resource-loaded schedule.

Process, not facts
------------------
Man-hour norms are PROJECT variables — they move with crew, site, height,
access and repetition — so nothing here carries a built-in rate. They are
supplied by the caller, sourced in order: the project's own records, the
project facts store, a cited published reference, or the operator. A category
with no supplied norm is REFUSED by name, because a programme resting on an
invented output looks exactly like a real one until it slips.

Output shape matches ``generate_wbs`` activities exactly (id/name/duration_days/
predecessors/resources/wbs_phase), so the existing CPM, cost-loading bridge and
Excel writers consume it unchanged.

# productivity record, not just a plan: each activity's man-hours (crew x
# duration x shift, or the resource assignment where one exists) divided by the
# quantity it delivered IS the norm for that work, measured on this project
# with these crews. Deriving it here puts the operator's OWN history first in
# the sourcing order, ahead of any published reference.
