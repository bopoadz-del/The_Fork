"""No party names leave this RAG.

Owner ruling, 2026-09-19: "No names at all from this RAG. No employer, project
name, no consultant, no contractor, no engineer."

``app/core/identifier_scrub.py`` removes names from a denylist kept in the
environment: whoever runs the deployment has to know every name in advance and
type it in. That is the right tool for a project's NAME, which no document
labels. It is the wrong tool for the PARTIES, because the documents label
them: a contract says who the Employer, the Engineer and the Contractor are,
in so many words. This module reads those labels out of the very excerpts the
answer was written from and replaces the names with the roles -- so the next
contract is covered the day it is uploaded, with nobody maintaining a list.

Facts stay. "The Engineer must respond within 28 days" is the product;
"<firm> must respond within 28 days" is the leak.

``RAG_WITHHOLD_PARTY_NAMES=0`` turns it off, for a deployment whose corpus
belongs to the people asking (a private per-client layer).
