"""Hydration scheduler — single asyncio background task that fires the
hydration block once per day at the configured hour (default 01:00 UTC,
i.e. inside the 1am-3am quiet window).

Lifecycle is owned by ``app/main.py``'s lifespan context manager: ``start()``
is called on app boot, ``stop()`` on shutdown. The task is a guarded infinite
loop — exceptions inside one run are logged but never bubble out, so a bad
night never kills the scheduler.

Disable for tests/dev by setting ``HYDRATION_ENABLED=false`` in the env.
