"""Single source of truth for upload size caps and accepted file types.

Why this module exists
----------------------
The platform had TWO upload paths that disagreed with each other:

* ``POST /upload`` (``app/routers/upload.py``) — 10 MB cap, its own extension
  set (which included audio/video, absent from the other).
* ``POST /v1/projects/{id}/documents`` (``app/routers/projects.py``) — 50 MB
  cap, its own extension set.

The chat composer posts to the second one, so a user's mental model of "what
the product accepts" was set by whichever route they happened to hit. A file
accepted by one route and 400'd by the other is indistinguishable, from the
browser, from the product being broken. Both routes now import from here, so
the limits move together or not at all.

The caps stay env-driven (``MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE`` / ``MAX_DOC_UPLOAD_SIZE``) and
are read through functions rather than bound at import time — binding at
import made them untestable without reloading the module, and made a
deployment-time env change silently ineffective for any module already
imported.
