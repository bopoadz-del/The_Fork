"""RestrictedPython sandbox — Reasoning Engine Plan 3.

Executes untrusted, LLM-generated Python in a jailed namespace so the
reasoning engine can run code it did not write without risking the host
process. The sandbox:

* compiles code with ``RestrictedPython.compile_restricted`` (AST rewrite),
* exposes only a whitelist of safe builtins and importable modules,
* injects session state as ordinary variables,
* captures ``print`` output and the value of a designated result variable,
* always returns a structured :class:`SandboxResult` — sandboxed code can
  fail, but it can never crash or escape the caller.

This is `app/core/sandbox.py`. It is unrelated to the legacy
`app/blocks/sandbox.py` block.
