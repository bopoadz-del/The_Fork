"""Cross-encoder reranker — flag-gated second-stage ranking (RAG_RERANKER).

STATUS: DORMANT BY VERDICT — ships flag-OFF and must stay off with the
default model. The offline proof (2026-08-02, scripts/rerank_offline_proof.py
against live drive_archive top-50) measured ms-marco-MiniLM reranking as
NEGATIVE: doc-recall@5 fell 47% -> 43%. MS-MARCO web-passage training
transfers badly to OCR-flavoured construction chunks. Full decision record +
enable-later checklist: docs/rag-reranker.md.

WHY IT EXISTS ANYWAY. The 2026-08-01 live measurement put doc-recall at 41%
@5 but 53% @50 — part of the gap is documents ranked 6th-50th, which is a
second-stage-ranking shape. The hook is model-agnostic: a DOMAIN-suitable
cross-encoder can be trialled later purely by env change (repo precedent for
shipping tested-but-dormant capability: layered RAG). Prove any candidate
offline against live top-50 FIRST; enable only on a measured lift.

HOW. ``rerank(query, chunks, k)`` scores each (query, chunk.text) pair with
a small cross-encoder and returns the top-k chunks by that score. The
retriever calls it AFTER every existing gate (noise filter, revision
suppression, GK cap) has already shaped the candidate pool — the reranker
only reorders survivors, it can never resurrect a suppressed or filtered
chunk.

OPS. Everything is env-gated and fails open:

  RERANK_ENABLED=false           canonical flag (default OFF — flag off is
                                 byte-identical to today's pipeline).
                                 Truthy values: 1 / true / yes / on.
  RAG_RERANKER=1                 alias kept for existing tests / .env files;
                                 ignored when RERANK_ENABLED is set.
  RAG_RERANKER_MODEL             cross-encoder checkpoint (default
                                 cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2,
                                 ~90MB — sized for the 512Mi web box)
  RAG_RERANK_CANDIDATES          candidate pool depth (default 50 — hybrid
                                 top-50, then cross-encoder picks top-k)

The model is lazy-loaded on first use (a process-wide singleton, cached
under HF_HOME like the embedder) so a flag-off boot pays zero memory. Any
failure — model missing, sentence-transformers absent, scoring error —
logs a warning and returns the original ordering: the reranker may only
ever improve on cosine order, never take the pipeline down with it.
