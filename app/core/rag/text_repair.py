"""Repair text-layer artefacts that make an indexed chunk unreadable.

One artefact so far: FAKE BOLD. Some PDF producers draw bold by printing each
glyph twice (occasionally three times) at a tiny offset, and the text layer
comes out as ``PPaarrttyy aanndd EEnnggiinneeeerr ddeettaaiillss``. Live, that
turned a Contract Data row into key ``CCOOBBSS((CC: HH22MM SSaauuddii ...``
value ``Clause (as`` -- and "Clause (as" was then returned as the Engineer.

Applied where chunk text is READ, so documents already in the index are
repaired without a re-index and every downstream rule sees the same text.

What matters most is what is NOT touched. ``1100``, ``2233``, ``AABB-0011``
are real quantities and drawing codes, and a repair that rewrote them would
be a worse defect than the one it fixes. So:

* a CHUNK is treated as fake-bold only when it carries at least three tokens
  that are unmistakably doubled (three or more repeated pairs, with letters);
  one such token in clean text is a coincidence and is left alone. The chunk,
  not the line: a table breaks lines at cells, and a doubled cell is often a
  single word (``|: | EEnnggiinneeeerr``);
* within such a chunk, only LINES that themselves carry a doubled word are
  touched;
* inside such a line only tokens that are doubled THROUGHOUT are collapsed,
  so a clean word keeps its own double letters (``address``, ``committee``);
* a digits-only token is collapsed only when the tokens on both sides of it
  were, because a number is the one thing that cannot vouch for itself.
