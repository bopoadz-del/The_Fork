"""Coverage honesty line + partial-index absence phrasing.

Every answer that knows its project must carry ``N of M project documents
indexed`` with live counts (or an explicit fixture tuple in tests). Below
100% the model is not allowed to say a clause ``does not exist`` or that
there is ``no such clause`` — those phrases claim a complete search of a
corpus that is still being ingested. Rewrite them to
``not found in the N indexed``.

The 2,935 / 6,206 pair used in tests is the historical coverage fixture,
not a claim about live Neon.
