"""Per-project chunk store backed by SQLAlchemy.

Storage shape: one row per chunk in the ``chunks`` table. On PostgreSQL
embeddings use ``pgvector`` ``vector(256)`` with cosine-distance ANN search
(``ORDER BY embedding <=> :q`` scoped by ``project_id``). On SQLite the
same table stores float32 BLOBs and search falls back to numpy cosine
similarity over the project's rows — slower but works everywhere.

Hybrid retrieval: when ``RAG_HYBRID_SEARCH`` is truthy and the caller
supplies ``query_text``, the store also runs a BM25 leg and fuses with
Reciprocal Rank Fusion. On PostgreSQL the BM25 leg is ``ts_rank`` over
the ``text_search`` tsvector column + GIN index (added by Alembic 0003).
On SQLite the BM25 leg is FTS5 over a ``chunks_fts`` external-content
virtual table maintained by AFTER INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE triggers on
``chunks``. See ``_ensure_fts5_sqlite`` for the trigger rationale.

SQLAlchemy-backed via app.core.db — unified The Fork schema.

    THE DEFECT THIS FIXES — the production retrieval failure
    --------------------------------------------------------
    The SQLite leg above OR-joins its tokens, and its docstring states the
    reason plainly: AND semantics return zero hits on natural-language queries,
    so BM25 can never contribute and hybrid collapses to semantic-only. That
    diagnosis was correct — and it was only ever applied to SQLite.

    PostgreSQL, which is what production runs, used ``plainto_tsquery``, and
    ``plainto_tsquery`` ANDs every term. The consequences in prod:

      * A chunk had to contain EVERY word of the question to be eligible. Ask
        "what is the soil backfilling specification" and only a chunk carrying
        soil AND backfilling AND specification could match.
      * ONE word absent from the whole corpus — a typo ("buiding"), a plural, a
        product name — reduced the entire BM25 leg to zero rows.
      * ``search()`` then hits ``if not bm25_results: return sem_results[:k]``
        and silently degrades to pure cosine, with nothing logged and nothing
        in the answer to say retrieval ran on one leg.

    So in production the lexical half of "hybrid" retrieval was dead for most
    real questions, and ranking fell to cosine alone over a corpus of thousands
    of chunks at k=5. That is why the same corpus answered a question correctly
    on one turn and reported the material absent on the next: nothing about the
    retrieval was stable, only the phrasing of the question changed.

    And it was structurally invisible to the test suite: dev and CI run SQLite,
    which takes the forgiving OR path, so no test could observe the semantics
    production actually used. The backends have to agree, which is what this
    makes true.

    ``websearch_to_tsquery`` is used rather than a hand-built ``to_tsquery``
    because it is the one tsquery parser designed for untrusted user input: it
    never raises a syntax error on stray punctuation or an unbalanced quote,
    where ``to_tsquery`` does.

# The bag-of-words tsquery above matches most of a large project: measured on
# live, "commencement date stated agreement pump station works" matched 57,069
# of the master corpus's 118,665 chunks. ``ORDER BY ts_rank LIMIT k`` then has
# to read every one of those tsvectors (most are TOASTed), twice -- once for
# ``@@`` and once for ``ts_rank`` -- which was ~155k buffers (1.2 GB) per call
# and ~80% of all the database reading one question did.
#
# The top-k does not need every match ranked. ``text_search`` is
# ``to_tsvector('english', text)``: every position carries weight D (0.1), and
# for an OR query ``ts_rank`` sums, per matched query lexeme, a term that is
# below 0.1 however often the lexeme occurs (0.1 * sum(1/j^2) / (pi^2/6)), then
# divides by the number of distinct query lexemes n. So a chunk matching m of
# the n lexemes ranks strictly below m * 0.1 / n. Once k chunks with rank >= tau
# are in hand, a chunk can only enter the top-k if it matches more than
# tau * n / 0.1 lexemes -- and "matches at least t of n lexemes" is something
# the GIN index can answer without touching the heap for the rest.
#
# ``_bm25_bounded`` ranks exactly the chunks the GIN index admits for a
# threshold t, and accepts the result only when the k-th rank it found proves
# no excluded chunk could beat it. Otherwise it widens t, and in the end falls
# back to the full scan. The result is identical to ranking every match.

          is provided): pulls 50 semantic + 50 BM25 candidates, fuses
          with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (k=60), returns top ``k`` by RRF
          score. Each returned chunk keeps its semantic cosine in
          ``.score`` and gets ``.rrf_score`` set for debug.

        Returns an empty list when the project has no indexed chunks.

        k=...)`` is preserved — ``query_text`` is a keyword-only-style
        opt-in. ``retriever.py`` does NOT pass it today, so the chat
