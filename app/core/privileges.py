Shared by /v1/execute, /v1/chain, the orchestrator, MCP call_tool AND the
agent runtime, so the 403 gate cannot drift across surfaces. An agent is only
as safe as the blocks it may call: the runtime refuses these blocks to a
non-admin caller, and an agent that holds one cannot be pinned, delegated to
or chatted with by a non-admin.
