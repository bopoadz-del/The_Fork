"""Outbound transactional email via Resend.

Only used for account lifecycle mail (address verification). Deliberately a
thin HTTP client over ``httpx`` rather than the ``resend`` SDK: httpx is
already a dependency, and keeping the call at the HTTP boundary means tests
can mock the transport and still exercise every line of our own logic.

Configuration (both required, else sending is treated as UNCONFIGURED):
  RESEND_API_KEY  -- server-side API key
  EMAIL_FROM      -- verified sender, e.g. "The Shovel <noreply@theshovel.ai>"
                     The domain must be verified in Resend or the send 4xxs.

There is no silent fallback. A caller that cannot send must decide what to do
about it -- returning success for an email that was never sent is the kind of
confident zero this codebase refuses.
