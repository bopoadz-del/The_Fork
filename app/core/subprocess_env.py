"""Scrubbed environment for subprocesses (security fix — audit §6.1).

Subprocesses spawned by the app — file converters (ODAFileConverter, antiword),
the code/bash sandbox block, hardware probes — previously inherited the FULL
parent environment, including ``SECRET_KEY``, ``DATABASE_URL`` (with the DB
password), the LLM/provider API keys, ``DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY``, cloud tokens,
and the master key. The bash sandbox could therefore ``echo $SECRET_KEY`` and
exfiltrate it to output.

This builds a copy of ``os.environ`` with every secret-bearing variable removed
while keeping functional system env (PATH, HOME, LANG, LC_*, TMPDIR,
QT_QPA_PLATFORM, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, TESSDATA_PREFIX, PYTHON*, NODE_*, …) intact.

**Denylist, not allowlist — deliberate.** A denylist can only ever REMOVE a
variable that a working subprocess never needed (secrets are not read by a DWG
converter or a code sandbox), so it cannot break a subprocess that was already
working. Over-stripping a non-secret *config* var is harmless because these
subprocesses do not read the app's configuration from the environment. On a
live deployment that "cannot regress a working path" property matters more than
the marginal tightness of an allowlist.
