"""Make a long ingest run's death observable.

WHY THIS EXISTS (production TIER-1 ingest on live #480, 567147a):

    [p1b-server] run_id=37159882e871 tier=1 folders=1 shard_index=0 ...
    [p1b-server] the client project 316/1361 [ok] ...
    <nothing, ever>

No traceback. No final tally line. No report JSON. Worker PID 829 was simply
gone and the log was stale. Two earlier runs stopped the same way at 315/1362
and 323/1380 on different images.

``scripts/p1b_ingest_drive_server.py`` has no path that can produce that.
Every early ``return`` in ``main()`` prints ``ERROR: ...`` first and all of
them are ABOVE the ``run_id=`` line; after that line the only ways out are the
end of the function (which prints the tally) and an exception (which the
interpreter prints as a traceback). A run that emits the run line and then
nothing did not exit — it was ENDED, from outside the interpreter or from
below it, and nothing in the process recorded which.

That is the actual defect this module fixes: the termination was
unobservable, so three runs produced three identical mysteries. The four ways
a Python process ends with no traceback, and what is recorded for each:

1. ``SIGTERM`` / ``SIGINT`` / ``SIGHUP`` — container recycle, a deploy of the
   web service the shell is attached to, or the Render Shell session closing
   on a run that was not a session leader. Handleable: ``install_signal_handlers``
   names the signal, the run drains what is in flight, and the caller's flush
   callback still writes a report marked ``complete: false``.
2. ``SIGKILL`` from the cgroup OOM killer. Not handleable — no handler runs, no
   atexit, no buffer flush. Recorded instead by a per-file sidecar heartbeat
   carrying RSS, ``memory.current``/``memory.max`` and the cgroup ``oom_kill``
   counter, plus ``previous_run_postmortem`` on the NEXT start. This is the
   leading suspect: ``app/core/extract_isolated`` measured ONE 4.4 MB PDF
   taking the live box from 790 MB to 3.9 GB of 4 GB before a SIGKILL, and the
   three deaths cluster at the same position in a size-sorted queue (files of
   4.7-4.9 MB), not at a random wall-clock moment.
3. A native crash — SIGSEGV/SIGABRT out of PyMuPDF, tesseract or torch — which
   prints nothing at all by default. ``enable_fault_handlers`` turns that into
   a C-level traceback for every thread.
4. The whole container being replaced. Distinguishable from 1-3 by host
   uptime: the sidecar records ``/proc/uptime`` on every heartbeat, so a
   post-mortem where uptime went BACKWARDS says the box is new, and one where
   it went forward says the process was killed on a box that kept running.

Nothing here fakes a completed run. ``phase``/``exit_reason`` carry the truth
and ``complete`` is false unless the work actually finished.
