"""Dynamic UNDERSTAND — the orchestrator's LLM-driven intent read.

Replaces the brittle keyword classifier for the workflow decision: the LLM reads
the message and returns which known workflow it is (if any) and whether the user
wants a DELIVERABLE or an ANSWER. This is the "dynamic reasoning over predefined
routes" the operator asked for — the model understands "how long is procurement"
is a QUESTION, which keyword routing (procurement_list_generator) cannot.

Runs on the configured cloud ladder (Kimi primary, Groq fallback) or on-prem
Ollama. Bounded output: a known workflow name or "none", so a bad/hallucinated
read simply falls through to the dynamic agent — never invents a step.
