"""Nightly hydration — the learning engine's "sleep on it" pass.

Lives under ``app/core/learning/`` because hydration IS learning: it reads
the day's conversations + files and writes back into the surfaces tomorrow's
chat actually consults. Exposed publicly as the ``hydrate`` operation on
:class:`app.blocks.learning_engine.LearningEngineBlock`; the routes under
``/v1/hydration/*`` and the nightly scheduler both call into this module
through that block.

What one pass does, per project that had activity yesterday (UTC by default):

1. Read every conversation message in the window from ``agent_memory.db``.
2. Summarize the day with ChatBlock, four-section markdown. If no LLM is
   reachable, ``_heuristic_project_summary`` produces the same shape from
   real signals (top keywords, friction patterns).
3. **Close the loop**: write recurring topics + friction signals back to
   ``projects.set_fact`` (read by the chat router via
   ``project_memory.build_memory_context``) AND ``agent_memory.set_agent_fact``
   (read by the runtime agent path at ``app/agents/runtime.py:548``), and
   record each friction signal as a pattern on the learning engine so it
   accumulates a corpus over time. This is what makes hydration "learning"
   instead of just an operator daily report.
4. Persist the row to ``hydration.db`` for the operator-facing endpoints.

Hydration reads conversations only. It never discovers, attaches, downloads
or re-indexes documents: the app reads an original only when a person asks
(an admin runs the ingest, or a user opens a cited document), and only the
admin path adds to a project's knowledge base (docs/INGEST_EXCLUSION_RULE.md).

Failures inside one project must not abort the whole run — each project is
isolated, errors are captured per-project in the row's ``facts`` payload.
