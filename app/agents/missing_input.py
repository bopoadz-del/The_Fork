"""AN ANSWER THAT NAMES ITS MISSING INPUT MUST GO AND GET IT (item 4).

F-E1-2, from ``FLEET_OPS/artifacts/gate_battery_13b2bf7_2026-08-31.md``:

    E1 | FAIL | "do not state the specific monetary rate per calendar day".
    ...
    E1 and E2 together are the proof for F-E1-2. One question apart, same
    session, same corpus: E2 retrieved the Accepted Contract Amount to
    complete its arithmetic; E1 said the figure it needed was not available.
    It is not a retrieval limit. E1 identified its missing input and did not
    go and get it.

The owner's rule: **one bounded retrieval attempt for any input the answer
names as missing.** One, not a loop -- an agent that keeps searching until
it finds something is how a wrong answer gets manufactured. If the single
attempt comes back with nothing that carries the named terms, the refusal
stands exactly as written.

This module is the DETECTION half and is deliberately pure: no retrieval, no
model, no I/O. It answers two questions about a draft answer --

    does this answer name something it lacks?   -> names_missing_input
    what should be searched for?                -> fetch_query

-- so both can be tested against the recorded string rather than against a
mock of the retriever.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It does not decide whether the thing exists. G5 refuses
a drawing that is genuinely not in the corpus, and this will happily name
that drawing as a missing input; the bounded fetch then returns nothing and
G5's refusal is unchanged. Distinguishing "absent" from "not retrieved" is
the fetch's job, not the detector's -- and the platform cannot know which it
is without looking, which is the whole reason the rule is "attempt once".
