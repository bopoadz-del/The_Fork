"""First-line figure + source, enforced on the answer the operator sees.

The Hard rule in the project-assistant and heavy-reasoning prompts already
tells the model to open with the figure and the document that carries it.
Live SET5 close-out on 209bc83 still scored the first line, and the model
still opened with a narrative, a bare figure, or "properly compacted".

This guard verifies the first line. When that line already credits the
figure the body commits to — including the clause and the document id
the chunk carries for it — the answer passes through unchanged.
Otherwise it may install only that figure. It never asks once that
commitment exists, and it does not leave a different document's name
on the opening line. 98% backfill, 90% storm-water bedding, and 95%
structural fill are different subjects. A question is prepended only
when the body commits to no figure and the remaining figures share one
subject. The filename class is a hint: when the chunk or the body
names the class ("Specification Section 9.1"), that naming governs,
and the server does not emit "That document is not the specification".
A report number that opens the chunk (RSM 15492) is the document id.
The same number named as a laboratory reference is not. A refusal is
not an answer when one handed chunk matches the subject the question
asked: that figure, its clause, and its document replace the refusal.
An optional higher compaction degree in the same clause ("could be
compacted to … under the approval of the engineer") is not a second
figure. A millimetre counts as concrete cover only when it is tied to
that quantity, not to a panel, tile, or paint band. A condition the
excerpt negates ("not in contact with soil", "other than structural
fill") is not that condition, and the first line does not print it on
the figure. "Which contract governs this project?" names the one
contract in the excerpts, or asks which when more than one non-template
contract is visible.
