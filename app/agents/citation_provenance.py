"""Citation provenance — an attribution the turn cannot back is not shipped.

THE INCIDENT (gate battery ``13b2bf7``, 2026-08-31, question F2). The WBS
answer closed with::

    BOQ context: Bill 03 - Example Works (AB-2001-101)

on a project whose contract is AB-2002-202. Three literal checks, not inference:

* ``generate_wbs`` (``app/containers/construction/schedule.py:2235``)
  documents itself "Deterministic template-based: no LLM"; its body contains
  no ``boq``/``bill``/``quantit``/``contract`` token at all. It has no BOQ
  input to read.
* The string ``BOQ context`` does not exist anywhere in this repository.
  Nothing composed that line; the model wrote it.
* The contract id it named belongs to a different contract year than the
  project under discussion.

So the sentence was not a mis-scoped retrieval that a fence could re-scope.
It was prose shaped like a citation, with no retrieval or tool run behind it.

THE RULE (owner's ruling, 2026-09-01): *the model never writes a Source
line.* Citations are rendered from EVIDENCE OBJECTS — retrieval records and
tool-run records with their actual inputs. Any Source / BOQ / contract
attribution in model prose that matches no evidence record is stripped and
the answer flagged "unverified attribution removed".

This module is the sibling of the cost-grounding gate in ``runtime.py``.
That one grounds the FIGURES; this one grounds the claim about WHERE the
figures came from. Same contract: flag-controlled, never raises, and it
edits the attribution only — an answer's content is never rewritten by it.

SCOPE, stated so the edges are known rather than discovered:

* Attributions are policed; content claims are not. "Clause 8.8.1 says X" is
  the numeric/­retrieval guards' business. "Source: AB-2001-101" is this one's.
* When the turn read the corpus at all, only the attribution surface is
  policed (Source lines, ``BOQ context:`` fragments, parenthesised ids), so a
  working answer that discusses a contract in prose is never mangled.
* When the turn read NO corpus — the F2 shape — every attribution in the
  answer is unbacked by construction, and ids the user did not themselves
  name are stripped wherever they appear.
* ``source_class`` is carried on every record and enforced here, and the
  retrieval marker now emits ``class=`` (the owner's numbered item 2), so
  the classes are live rather than a forward fence. ``project_corpus`` and
  ``master_corpus`` may back an identifier attribution; ``knowledge_base``
  and ``template`` may not. A reference note or a blank form is a real
  document and may still be NAMED as a source — what it may not do is lend
  its identifiers to a claim about this project's contract, which is the
  template-quoted-as-the-contract shape.
* A figure a calculator actually returned is credited to that calculation
  and the tool's own notes (the inputs it was given, and the note lines it
  emitted). A retrieved chunk that did not produce the figure — a ``Source:``
  line or an inline "chunk N" — is not that credit. A chunk that supplied a
  governing input may still be named for that input. An answer with no
  calculator result is left untouched.
