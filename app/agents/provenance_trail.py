"""Provenance trail of the answer being written in this task.

Every assistant answer carries a record of where each of its figures and
facts came from -- user input, project document (doc and page), general
knowledge (doc and page), or calculator (formula and inputs). The record is
built by ``app.agents.citation_provenance.figure_provenance`` from the turn's
evidence objects, streamed on the end event, and stored with the message.

This module only holds the source-kind vocabulary and the per-task slot the
message store reads; it decides nothing.
