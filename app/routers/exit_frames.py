"""The exit check on EVERY chat stream, not just the agent's.

``app/routers/chat.py`` and ``app/routers/agents.py`` answer a turn on several
paths (the agent, heavy reasoning, predefined dispatch), and the last two
build their own ``end`` at the router. One wrapper where the response is
built covers every path that exists and the next one somebody adds, the same
way ``hat_frames`` does for hat activation.

The client replaces the streamed bubble with ``end.content`` (or the
accumulated tokens when there is none), so the checked text is put on the
``end`` frame: what stays on screen and what the Sources list shows is what
:mod:`app.agents.answer_exit` let through.

Any failure passes the frame through unchanged.
