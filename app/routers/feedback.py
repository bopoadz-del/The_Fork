"""Routing-feedback surface — the "Wrong action, should be X" signal that
makes the chat router actually self-correcting.

Persists corrections as ``routing_decisions`` patterns on
:class:`app.blocks.learning_engine.LearningEngineBlock` with
``corrected: true``. The data-extraction layer in
``app/core/learning/router.py`` already filters these via the
``label_quality="corrected"`` lever; ``train_router`` accepts a
``prefer_corrected: bool`` switch (PR 1) that drops the noisy "auto"
rows once enough corrections accumulate.

In plain terms: PR 1 trained on what the keyword router *did*. This
route lets users tell us what the keyword router *should have done*.
